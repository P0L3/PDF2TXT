['Implications of the iron oxide phase transition on the interiors of rocky exoplanets']
he ever-growing number of confirmed extrasolar planets includes many terrestrial bodies much larger than the Earth . Most current models describing the interior composition of these rocky exoplanets assume a scaled version of the Earth’s layered structure, with an iron core surrounded by a silicate-dominated mantle with proportions determined by stellar elemental abundances, planet-forming processes and mass–radius relations from astronomical observations . This approach, although necessary to overcome the inherent ambiguities generated by the scarcity of data available, neglects some of the material properties that originate from the higher pressure and temperature conditions existing in the interior of planets more massive than the Earth. For example, pressures of ~600 GPa and temperatures of 3,000–5,000 K (ref. ) are expected at the core–mantle boundary (CMB) of terrestrial planets as big as 5 (Earth masses), dwarfing the 135 GPa and ~2,500 K at the Earth CMB (Supplementary Fig. 1). While bridgmanite ((Mg,Fe)SiO ) and ferropericlase (Mg-rich (Mg,Fe)O solid solution) dominate the Earth’s mantle, the mineralogy of massive terrestrial planets is largely unknown . In addition to the more extreme pressure and temperature conditions, which are likely to induce phase transitions and dissociations , the composition of their mantle may also be substantially different from that of the Earth’s mantle. The (Mg Fe)/ Si ratio of the mantle controls the abundance of the different mineralogical phases and it is expected to vary over a wide range for exoplanets, reflecting the large distribution of host star metallicities as well as the different planet-forming processes. The distribution of Fe between the mantle and core may also show large variations, as the planet’s oxidation state during accretion and the volatilization of Si or its sequestration into the core are factors determining the amount of iron in the core versus in the oxides and silicates of the mantle . Thus, understanding the behaviour of (Mg,Fe)O and iron-rich phases across a wide range of pressures, temperatures and iron contents is important for modelling the interior structure and dynamics of rocky exoplanets. Despite its importance, very little is known about ferropericlase at the relevant conditions. Challenges from a computational perspective are mostly associated with the numerical treatment of the electronic correlations of iron . Experimentally, reproducing in the laboratory the extreme states expected inside massive planets is still very challenging. As a consequence, most studies have either investigated lower pressure and temperature conditions or have focused on the Mg-rich endmembers. In this work we used laser-driven compression combined with in situ nanosecond X-ray diffraction to experimentally constrain the crystal structure and pressure–density relation of iron oxide (Fe O, wüstite) at conditions expected in the interior of large rocky exoplanets. Our data demonstrate the stability of the B2 phase, discovered in laser-heating diamond anvil cell experiments , between 300 and 700 GPa (Fig. 1). Combining these with previous data on the magnesium oxide (MgO, periclase) endmember , we investigated the properties of the MgO–FeO system by calculating its binary phase diagram. While the high pressure and temperature behaviour of MgO has been extensively investigated both experimentally and with numerical methods, many questions concerning FeO remain open. The B1 phase (NaCl structure) of MgO is stable up to at least 250 GPa at room temperature and transforms to the B2 phase (CsCl structure) between 400 and 600 GPa (depending on the temperature ), which has been observed up to ~1,800 GPa (Supplementary Fig. 1). Iron oxide instead presents a more complex polymorphism which includes four different phases below 400 GPa: B1 and rhombohedral distortion rB1 , hexagonal B8 (NiAs structure ) and cubic B2 (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 6). At higher pressure, although there are so far no structural experimental data, numerical simulations predict additional phase transitions and new stoichiometries . To investigate these predictions, we performed six different experiments at the Omega Laser Facility (University of Rochester, NY) to dynamically compress wüstite above 400 GPa using quasi-isentropic ramp compression and simultaneously determine its atomic structure via nanosecond X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1 and Methods). An approximately 10 m-thick Fe O ( 0.94, Methods) pressed-powder sample was enclosed between two flat diamond plates acting as ablator and window. The diamond/FeO/diamond stack was placed on a 150 m-thick tantalum foil having a collimating aperture 300 m in diameter (Fig. 1a and Methods). The surface of the first diamond was ablated using up to six Omega laser beams with power increasing over ~4.5–6 ns (Supplementary Fig. 5a). This produced a series of pressure waves propagating through the target package and ramp-compressing the FeO through multiple wave reverberations. The compression waves eventually reached the rear surface of the back diamond, accelerating it into free space. A velocity interferometer system for any reflector (VISAR) recorded the diamond free-surface velocity as a function of time, ( ) (Fig. 1b), which was used to infer the sample pressure during the X-ray snapshot (Methods). A copper or iron foil located about 25 mm from the FeO sample was irradiated by additional lasers (Fig. 1a) to generate a 1 ns pulse of quasi-monochromatic X-rays with energies of 8,368 eV and 6,683 eV (for copper and iron, respectively), incident at ~45° from the sample normal (Methods). Diffracted X-rays from the sample as well as from the edges of the Ta collimating aperture (providing a reference for the diffraction geometry) were recorded in transmission by image plate detectors (Methods and Supplementary Information). Varying the laser energy and the timing of the X-ray flash to probe near peak compression, we determined the structure of FeO over a large pressure range, between 357 and 664 GPa (Fig. 1d). In situ X-ray diffraction measurements document the stability of the B2 phase, as demonstrated by the observation of two diffraction peaks corresponding to the (100) and (110) reflections of B2-FeO (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). The measured spacings between diffracting planes (that is, -spacing) for the two reflections are reported in Fig. 2 (blue circles) and their decrease at high pressure is in very good agreement with the trend for B2-FeO measured in lower pressure static compression experiments (blue squares) . This indicates that the B1 and B8 phases observed in diamond anvil cell experiments do not form above 300 GPa (Fig. 2; the red and yellow curves show B1 and B8 structures, respectively) and that the B1–B2 phase transition is fast enough to be observed on nanosecond timescales. A number of different structures, which are also associated with changes in stoichiometry, have been observed experimentally below 100 GPa (ref. ) and are also predicted by numerical simulations to arise in the hundreds of gigapascals range . Our data, however, indicate that the B2 structure is formed in the pressure regime explored here (Supplementary Information). From the measured -spacing, we determined the density of B2-FeO at extremely high pressures (blue circles in Fig. 3; Methods and Supplementary Information). Reaching almost 700 GPa, our experiments substantially expand upon existing data and provide direct constraints to the density of FeO inside terrestrial exoplanets as large as 5 (right axis in Fig. 3) . Within the mantle of such planets, FeO would have a density exceeding 13 g cm , which is a more than twofold compression and almost twice as dense as MgO at the same conditions (open diamonds in Fig. 3 (ref. )). The large density contrast between the endmembers of the ferropericlase solid solution therefore persists up to the high pressures expected inside massive exoplanets. From Fig. 3 one can also observe that, while FeO transforms to the B2 structure around 300 GPa, in MgO this phase change happens above 600 GPa (at high temperature). The difference in the occurrence of the B1–B2 transition could affect the mixing behaviour of the MgO–FeO system, with important consequences for the interior structure of rocky extrasolar planets 2–5 (white background colour in Fig. 3). High pressure and temperature experimental data for ferropericlase (and magnesiowüstite, the Fe-rich (Mg,Fe)O solid solution) are scarce and limited to pressures below ~200 GPa (crossed squares and circles in Fig. 3 for two different compositions). Complete solubility of isostructural MgO and FeO has been demonstrated experimentally at Earth mantle pressures , where (Mg,Fe)O also assumes the B1 phase and does not undergo any structural change (other than a rhombohedral distortion for Fe-rich compositions ) up to 150 GPa. The miscibility of MgO and FeO at higher pressure and temperature is, however, largely unknown, and it has been proposed that the occurrence of phase transitions in FeO could prevent the formation of a complete solid solution with B1-MgO . Decomposition of (Mg,Fe)O into Feand Mg-rich domains has been reported in samples recovered from high-pressure/high-temperature experiments , although this was not confirmed by more recent in situ X-ray diffraction measurements . To shed light on the mixing properties of (Mg,Fe)O at high pressure, we calculated the pressure–composition phase diagram of the binary MgO–FeO system at 4,000 K, a representative temperature for the mantle of a 5 exoplanet . Assuming an ideal solution model and using the measured B1– B2 transition pressure for the MgO and FeO endmembers, along with their volumes as obtained from our X-ray diffraction data, we calculated the binary phase loop as a function of composition (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Information). A B1/B2 coexisting region forms between 270 GPa and 600 GPa (the B1–B2 transition pressures of the endmembers at 4,000 K) depending on composition. Red arrows illustrate the fate of a representative sample with initial (Mg ,Fe )O composition and B1 structure. At ~430 GPa, the solid solution breaks down into B1-Mg-rich domains and B2-Fe-rich domains, whose compositions change upon further pressure increase following the phase loop, as indicated by the dashed lines. Above 530 GPa the binary system recovers the initial composition and fully adopts the B2 structure. This implies that the B1–B2 phase transition in ferropericlase proceeds through a gradual change in composition, with B2-Fe-rich domains being formed as pressure increases. This behaviour, which is related to material properties at extreme pressures, suggests that the mineralogy of large terrestrial exoplanets may be dramatically different from that of the Earth. The mantle of a 5 exoplanet could indeed show, in addition to the perovskite-to-post-perovskite phase transition in bridgmanite at ~125 GPa , new and more complex stratification due to the formation of the coexisting B1/B2 region followed by the B2 layer (Fig. 4b). Based on our density measurements for the endmembers and our mixing model, the mixed B1/B2 region is characterized by a large density contrast that could be as high as 17% (Supplementary Fig. 14). Within the stability field of post-perovskite at Earth mantle conditions, recent measurements report that Fe partitions strongly into ferropericlase over post-perovskite, with a distribution coefficient for iron 0.1–0.2 (Supplementary Information). If this persists at higher pressures, the silicate component of a terrestrial exoplanet mantle would be iron depleted and have a density a factor of two lower than the B2-rich domains, therefore contributing to the heterogeneity of the mantle (Supplementary Information). Furthermore, recent theoretical calculations on silicates at extreme conditions suggest that MgSiO may undergo structural transformations and changes in stoichiometry beyond the bridgmanite to post-perovskite phase transition . In the presence of ferropericlase this may favour additional stratification and generate new exchanges with the iron that do not happen within the Earth mantle. I The formation of domains with B2 structure could dramatically affect the deep mantle rheology and the dynamic behaviour of the planet. Numerical simulations on MgO suggest that the B1– B2 phase change may be associated with a large increase in atomic diffusivity driven by the change in coordination number from six to eight across the B1–B2 phase transition, lowering the energy barrier of vacancy diffusion and enhancing diffusion-controlled creep . This is also in agreement with the observation of smaller creep strength of B2-CsCl compared to B1-NaCl . The B1–B2 transition could therefore result in an important drop in viscosity that could be as high as a factor of 100 (ref. ) or more (~10,000, ref. ). Further reduction could also originate from the presence of iron if the behaviour inferred from recent Earth’s rheology models indicating a lower viscosity for iron-rich (Mg,Fe)O over ferropericlase persists at higher pressure and for the B2 phase. The progressive formation of B2-Fe-rich domains at the expense of the B1 phase can therefore have a viscosity-weakening effect and create a region with a gradient in rheological properties that is transitional between the higher viscosity of the upper layer (B1 post-perovskite) and the lower ones in the deep interiors, where an additional reduction in viscosity may occur due to the formation of the B2-(Mg,Fe)O layer (Fig. 4b). Considering the viscosity reduction of two to three orders of magnitude expected at the B1/B2 transition and recent geodynamic simulations , the deep mantle of large exoplanets could exhibit formation of layered convection near the CMB, with important implications for thermal evolution, heat flow and the ability to generate and sustain a geodynamo. While high-viscosity silicate phases are likely to be more abundant than ferropericlase in most planets, the viscosity and rheology of the mantle can readily be controlled by the weaker minority phase through the formation of interconnected weak layers and/or heterogeneous strain, as demonstrated for the case of ferropericlase in the Earth’s lower mantle . Thus, the weak B2-(Mg,Fe)O phase is likely to play a key role in the whole-mantle mineralogy for many exoplanets. Silicate phases are also predicted to undergo increases in cation coordination at deep exoplanet conditions , and if such transitions occur, they would also be likely to enhance diffusion and reduce viscosity . Thus, the tendency towards viscosity reduction in the deep mantle may extend beyond just the (Mg,Fe)O system, and other mantle phases may contribute as well. Despite the importance of the mantle viscosity, which strongly influences thermal evolution, tectonic activity, tidal dissipation and magnetic field generation, it is a poorly constrained quantity, especially for exoplanets . The variations in rheological properties suggested by our model open the possibility that the mantle dynamics in large exoplanets may be much more complex than in the Earth. Additionally, the B2-Fe-rich phases and the B2-(Mg,Fe)O might become metallic at high pressures and temperatures . A metallic region with relatively low viscosity near the CMB might increase the electromagnetic coupling between the core and the mantle, enhancing convection and heat transport out of the core and affecting the strength and expression of the magnetic field . Even though our model is based on ideal mixing of FeO and MgO, and possible deviations from ideal behaviour should be considered, the enhanced complexity and stratification of large rocky exoplanets that emerges from it would be unchanged. If a miscibility gap formed and the ferropericlase dissociated into its components, layering would still occur inside the planet, and the density contrast as well as the viscosity jump could be even more dramatic. Our study indicates that iron, which is often not included in the modelling of planetary mantles, could crucially affect the internal structure of terrestrial exoplanets. This work illustrates how dynamic compression and X-ray diffraction experiments can provide important insights into material behaviour deep inside large planets. With the ever-growing number of confirmed exoplanets, the quickly progressing technology enabling improved mass–radius measurements and more direct observations providing tighter constraints on chemistry and composition, laboratory experiments become the much-needed link between astronomical observations and planetary modelling.
