['Enhancement of\xa0the\xa0relationship between\xa0the\xa0winter Arctic oscillation and\xa0the\xa0following summer circulation anomalies over\xa0central East Asia since\xa0the\xa0early 1990sPage 17 Fig. 14 Anomalies of Niño 3.4 SST ( solid line , °C) obtained via a regression on the MCA1 time series for SST for the period 1996–2015. Marks denote the SST anomalies that are significant at the 99% confi- dence level 3501 been  observed  over  central  China,  and  accompanied  by significantly  more  (less)  precipitation  than  usually  falls over  northeastern  China.  However,  the  lagged  impact  of the winter AO on the summer climate anomalies over East Asia is not significant before the 1990s. The  enhanced  connection  between  the  winter  AO and  the  following  summer  CEAI  after  the  early  1990s  is largely  due  to  the  enhanced  connection  between  the  win- ter AO and the following summer ISM rainfall in the same period.  After  the  early  1990s,  a  negative  (positive)  winter AO  favors  increasing  (decreasing)  rainfall  over  the  ISM region,  which  triggers  a  positive  (negative)  CGT,  and results  in  significantly  positive  (negative)  CEAI  anoma- lies.  One  way  the  winter  AO  may  influence  the  following summer  ISM  rainfall  is  that  the  negative  (positive)  winter AO-related  cyclonic  (anticyclonic)  circulation  anomalies over the midlatitude areas of the North Atlantic could per- sist  for  a  longer  period,  and  the  North  Atlantic  SST  trip- ole pattern induced by the cyclonic (anticyclonic) circula- tion anomalies can persist into the following March–April (MA + 1)  and  evolves  into  a  positive  (negative)  tropical Atlantic  pattern  during  the  following  summer.  In  other words, the negative (positive) winter AO memories can be sustained by a significantly positive (negative) TAI during the following summer, which favors the La Niña (El Niño) developing  phase  through  a  zonally  overturning  circula- tion anomaly with ascending (descending) motions over the tropical Atlantic and descending (ascending) motions over the  tropical  central-eastern  Pacific,  as  well  as  increased (decreased) the rainfall over the ISM region. However, both the connections between the winter AO and the following summer ISM rainfall and that between the ISM rainfall and the CEAI during the summer are relatively weak before the 1990s. Some problems remain unresolved. First, previous stud- ies  found  that  the  relationship  between  ENSO  and  the summer  ISM  rainfall  have  weakened  after  the  late  1970s (Krishna  Kumar  et\xa0 al.  1999;  Wang  et\xa0 al.  2001),  while  the findings  of  the  present  study  show  that  the  influence  of ENSO  on  the  summer  ISM  rainfall  seems  to  be  strength- ened  after  the  early  1990s  (Fig.\xa0 12).  The  summer  tropical Atlantic  SST  anomalies  likely  contribute  to  the  decadal modulation of the ENSO-ISM rainfall relationship. At the same  time,  besides  exciting  the  ENSO  developing  phase through a zonally overturning circulation, the summer trop- ical Atlantic SST may impact the simultaneous ISM rainfall independently of ENSO, as suggested by the conclusions of Kucharski et\xa0al. (2007, 2008, 2009). The roles of the sum- mer tropical Atlantic SST in the decadal modulation of the ENSO-ISM rainfall relationship and its independent effects on  the  Asian  summer  monsoon  over  the  past  two  decades require  further  investigation  for  validation.  Second,  note that  a  strong  AO/NAO-tropical  Atlantic  SST  connection since  the  early  1990s  is  more  likely  to  be  associated  with higher  mean  SST  values  in  the  Atlantic  as  demonstrated by Chen et\xa0al. (2015a), the enhanced delayed impact of the winter  AO  on  the  following  summer  TAI  after  the  early 1990s  may  depend  not  only  on  the  AO/NAO  regime  shift but also on the mean state of the Atlantic SST. A more rea- sonable explanation of the AO/NAO- tropical Atlantic SST connection during different periods is needed. Furthermore,  other  paths  may  also  play  an  important role  in  linking  the  winter  AO  and  the  climate  of  the  fol- lowing  summer  in  East  Asian  after  the  early  1990s.  As suggested  by  Ogi  et\xa0 al.  (2003),  the  wintertime  AO/NAO- related  sea  ice  anomalies  over  the  Arctic  and  the  snow- cover  anomalies  over  eastern  Siberia  that  persist  from winter to summer; these anomalies then influence the sum- mertime  atmospheric  circulation  in  the  extratropics.  Cui et\xa0al. (2015) revealed that the wintertime AO/NAO-induced SSTA  tripole  pattern  over  the  North  Atlantic  may  exert  a seasonally-lagged  impact  upon  the  EASM  by  modulating the  thermal  forcing  over  the  Tibetan  Plateau.  Gong  et\xa0 al. (2016) suggested that the winter AO is significantly corre- lated with the following summer SST of the western tropi- cal  Indian  Ocean  by  its  influence  on  the  oceanic  Rossby waves, which may have a feedback on the CEAI. The pos- sible  roles  of  these  “bridges”  in  modulating  the  enhanced Enhancement of\xa0the\xa0relationship between\xa0the\xa0winter Arctic oscillation and\xa0the\xa0following summer… 1 3 Page 18 3502 S.\xa0Qiao et al. connection between the winter AO and the following sum- mer  CEAI  after  the  early  1990s  require  further  analysis. Additionally,  the  internal  atmospheric  dynamics  of  the summer  CEAI  might  also  be  associated  with  the  preced- ing  winter  AO.  These  problems  remain  to  be  resolved  by means of diagnostic analyses and numerical simulations in our subsequent work.
