<br>(AMS) journals for six years. The twin goals of ECs when they were established were to
<br>reduce the time from submission to publication of research papers and to encourage authors
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvPSTIM10-R; font-size:9px">to develop short, concise contributions to the journals. When ECs were created, the time to
<br>initial decision was nearly 80 days, and the production time (the time between acceptance
<br>and appearance online in ﬁnal form) was approximately 160 days.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:99px; top:321px; width:370px; height:93px;"><span style="font-family: AdvPSTIM10-R; font-size:9px">Since then, the time to initial decision has been reduced to 60 days, and also the pro-
<br>duction time has decreased to around 70 days. In addition, with the introduction of Early
<br>Online Releases, papers appear online with a digital object identiﬁer (DOI) within 10 days
<br>of acceptance. With these dramatic improvements in the efﬁciency of peer review and
<br>production, the AMS Publications Department has succeeded in achieving the ﬁrst goal
<br>above. While the second goal will always remain something to strive for and to encourage
<br>our authors to meet, it was not the primary driver in creating ECs—reduction of production
<br>time was.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:99px; top:416px; width:370px; height:105px;"><span style="font-family: AdvPSTIM10-R; font-size:9px">With this greater efﬁciency in the publication process, author interest in ECs has declined.
<br>Currently, only 6.1% of submissions arrive as ECs. One of the criteria that the AMS Pub-
<br>lications Commission (PC) has for ECs is that they undergo review with only minor re-
<br>visions. Those with major revisions are converted to articles and moved into the regular
<br>workﬂow. In 2016, 34.6% of the submissions were converted or rejected. After these papers
<br>are accounted for, only 4% of all submissions are now processed through the workﬂow as
<br>ECs. This processing comes with a large amount of overhead in ﬁnding reviewers who are
<br>willing to return reviews in 2 weeks, a need to separate papers into two classes, and a need
<br>for AMS staff to give special attention to the ECs.

Trend in time to initial decision for articles and ECs from 2012 to 2016.

<br>history of ECs. Figure 1 shows the trend in submissions of ECs since 2012. There is
<br>clearly a declining interest in ECs from our authors. The PC also examined the difference
<br>in time to initial decision between standard articles and ECs (Fig. 2). This difference
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvPSTIM10-R; font-size:9px">declined from 29.2 to 17 days. The PC also analyzed other statistics, such as the number
<br>of reviewers who had to be invited to obtain sufﬁcient reviewers for a manuscript, the
<br>number of days required to obtain reviewers, and the rejection rates for ECs versus
<br>standard articles.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:96px; top:1152px; width:370px; height:69px;"><span style="font-family: AdvPSTIM10-R; font-size:9px">From all of this information, the PC concluded that ECs were no longer a feature that the
<br>vast majority of AMS authors used and that they no longer served the purpose of signiﬁ-
<br>cantly reducing the time from submission to publication of research papers. On the basis of
<br>the analysis, the PC voted unanimously to eliminate Expedited Contributions beginning in
<br>January 2018. All papers submitted as ECs prior to January 2018 (and accepted as ECs) will
<br>continue as ECs throughout production.
