<br>climatic variability corresponding to present climatic
<br>conditions. A small climatic drift was noted during the
<br>simulation, and all results presented are based on detr-
<br>ended conditions. The emphasis here is on El Nin˜ o/
<br>Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and their secular
<br>variability during the simulation. A number of features
<br>of the simulated ENSO climatology are presented and
<br>compared with observations. These demonstrate that the
<br>model reproduced the major characteristics of observed
<br>ENSO variability. A variety of analyses is given to
<br>illustrate secular variability of ENSO-related climate.
<br>Thus, while the simulated Southern Oscillation is shown
<br>to be a robust feature of the model climatology, decadal
<br>and oscillatory time variations occurred. Time-smooth-
<br>ing of the Southern Oscillation Index revealed underly-
<br>ing multi-decadal episodes, with associated climatic
<br>anomalies. Examination of ‘strong’ ENSO events high-
<br>lighted an asymmetry between El Nin˜ o and La Nin˜ a
<br>events, similar to that observed, with clear secular
<br>variability in the occurrence rate of La Nin˜ a events.

<br>largest source of interannual climatic variability. Despite
<br>the importance of such events, the brevity of the directly
<br>observed record (about 120 years, Allan et al. 1996)
<br>limits our knowledge of their secular variability. As a
<br>consequence, it remains a matter of dispute whether, for
<br>example, the multiple El Nin˜ o events of the early 1990s
<br>are attributable to the greenhouse eﬀect (Trenberth and
<br>Hoar 1996), or are just a consequence of natural climatic
<br>variability (Allan and D’Arrigo 1999).

<br>subtle than implied already. As noted by Lui and Huang
<br>(2000) there is an observed warming trend in the low-
<br>latitude Paciﬁc Ocean, which, however caused, may be
<br>generating an oceanic state more conducive to El Nin˜ o
<br>events. This warming trend is associated with, and feeds
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">back upon, a weakening of the zonal wind stress in this
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">region.

<br>acteristics also exist. These include the frequency of
<br>‘super’ ENSO events (such as the 1982/3 El Nin˜ o), the
<br>interaction between ENSO events and the Interdecadal
<br>Paciﬁc Oscillation, relative frequency of El Nin˜ o versus
<br>La Nin˜ a events, the stationarity of ENSO climatology,
<br>variations in teleconnections, spatial characteristics,
<br>oceanic responses, etc. Not all of these will be discussed
<br>here.

<br>conﬁdence in any simulations of greenhouse-induced
<br>ENSO changes. In addition, a sound knowledge of the

<br>order to diﬀerentiate between natural climatic variability
<br>and greenhouse-induced climatic changes in ENSO
<br>(Knutson and Manabe 1994).

<br>matic model. Various aspects of the model’s overall climatology
<br>have been presented in a number of papers (Gordon and
<br>O’Farrell 1997; Hirst et al. 2000; Watterson et al. 1995; Hunt
<br>2001). In particular, a number of ENSO characteristics of the
<br>present model and 16 other coupled models have been docu-
<br>mented by AchutaRao and Sperber (2000). This documentation
<br>highlights the diﬃculties all of these models have in reproducing
<br>adequately the observed ENSO climatology. The principal deﬁ-
<br>ciencies of the CSIRO model revealed in this documentation are
<br>low-latitude Paciﬁc Ocean SST anomalies, which are too weak by
<br>a factor of about two, resulting in rainfall anomalies which are
<br>also too small, and an ENSO periodicity greater than the ob-
<br>served range of two to seven years. Overall, the CSIRO model
<br>appeared to be a mid-level performer in this intercomparison.
<br>However, this model performed well in the more extensive inter-
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:8px">comparison presented by Covey et al. (2000).

<br>was an extension of the 100-year run used in the earlier two in-
<br>tercomparisons. The model experienced a slight downwards drift in
<br>the annual mean, globally averaged screen air temperature, from
<br>approximately 13.8</span><span style="font-family: AdvPSSym; font-size:8px">(cid:2) </span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:8px">to 13.6</span><span style="font-family: AdvPSSym; font-size:8px">(cid:2) </span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:8px">during the course of the 1000-year

<br>variables. Consequently, all results presented here have been detr-
<br>ended by removing the drift at each gridpoint prior to analysis.

<br>to 1990) and simulated composited El Nino SST anomalies for
<br>December, January and February. The corresponding comparison
<br>for La Nina events is shown in Fig. 2. For consistency with the
<br>model, all NCEP/NCAR observations presented here have been
<br>interpolated to R21 resolution from their original resolutions. The
<br>model replicated the observed features extremely well, not only in
<br>the Paciﬁc Ocean but also the Atlantic and Indian oceans. The
<br>characteristic equatorial maximum in the value of the SST anom-
<br>alies in the Paciﬁc Ocean, and the horseshoe pattern of opposite
<br>sign anomalies, together with the reversal of signs between El Nin˜ o
<br>and La Nin˜ a events, which are critical features of ENSO events, are
<br>all simulated. The major discrepancy, as noted, is that the model
<br>simulation does not attain the observed amplitude of the SST
<br>anomalies in the equatorial Paciﬁc Ocean, and the simulated
<br>maxima are too far to the west. These outcomes are attributable to
<br>various model deﬁciencies, especially the low horizontal resolution.

<br>easier for the climatic system to ‘relax’, thereby pro-
<br>ducing El Nin˜ o events, rather than for it to be forced
<br>more strongly, as is required for La Nin˜ a events. For
<br>example, the latter requires a strengthening of the pre-
<br>vailing, low-latitude east winds, which then have to in-
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">duce stronger upwelling in the eastern Paciﬁc Ocean.
<br>Such strengthening requires sources of both energy and
<br>angular momentum. The enhanced upwelling raises the

<br>face. However, the stronger mixing in the upper ocean
<br>induced by the increased wind strength acts to maintain
<br>the mixed layer depth in opposition to the enhanced
<br>upwelling. This mutual interplay acts as a natural limit
<br>on the magnitude of La Nin˜ a events. In contrast, the

<br>mal demands on the climate system.

<br>climatic variability (see Hunt 1998, 2000b, 2001; Hunt
<br>and Elliott 2002) for other examples of this phenom-

<br>erator of decadal and longer responses</span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">. Such processes
<br>would then be responsible, for example, for the qui-
<br>escent period in the observed SOI between 1920 and
<br>1940 (Allan et al. 1996). This does not preclude a role
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">of deterministic inﬂuences in the climatic system as
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">complex, long-lasting atmospheric–oceanic interactions
<br>obviously occur. ENSO events are the most obvious

<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">of the diﬀerences between ENSO events, and they are

<br>a duration of at least four years, during which time the

<br>did not change sign. In contrast, the SOI value, which

<br>ENSO events, as the smallness of
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">anomalies in the model resulted in rather noisy pressure

<br>anomalies were usually located at a depth of 50 to
<br>100 m, having initially developed at a depth of 100 to
<br>200 m in the western Paciﬁc Ocean. These anomalies are
<br>simply a reﬂection of the change in the orientation of the
<br>local
<br>isotherms associated with the response of the
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">thermocline to the surface wind stresses. On numerous
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">occasions substantial, well-deﬁned anomalies did not
<br>penetrate to the surface and ENSO events did not then
<br>occur. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in
<br>determining when, or whether, a given anomaly pene-
<br>trates to the surface would greatly enhance knowledge of
<br>the processes involved in creating ENSO events. An
<br>example of such oceanic temperature anomalies, which
<br>occurred in conjunction with the extended El Nin˜ o event
<br>in Fig. 11a, is shown in Fig. 12 for years 309 to 314. As
<br>can be seen a persistent oceanic temperature anomaly
<br>was an intrinsic component of this event, with the
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">anomaly extending from depth to the surface, although
<br>the maximum value was normally at about 50 m depth.
<br>Examination of monthly values corresponding to the
<br>annual mean time series in Fig. 12, revealed high con-
<br>sistency in the month-to-month pattern of positive
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:303px; top:6201px; width:243px; height:225px;"><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">anomalies. Even late in year 310 when this anomaly
<br>became somewhat weaker, it subsequently re-established
<br>itself in situ, as opposed to being replaced by a new
<br>anomaly transiting from the west. Much more variabil-
<br>ity was apparent in the negative temperature anomalies
<br>in the west Paciﬁc Ocean mixed layer. However, starting
<br>they strengthened and eventually
<br>late in year 311,
<br>dominated the positive anomalies by the end of year 313.
<br>Thus, a prerequisite for a persistent El Nin˜ o event is the
<br>multi-annual
<br>residence of an oceanic temperature
<br>anomaly in the mixed layer of the central and eastern
<br>Paciﬁc Ocean, as opposed to a succession of transient
<br>positive anomalies emanating from the western Paciﬁc
<br>Ocean. The limited observations to date in the NOAA
<br>Climate Diagnostics Bulletin appear to support this
<br>scenario. The major diﬀerence between the observations
<br>and the current simulation is that the former have much
<br>larger amplitude temperature anomalies, a result con-
<br>sistent with the model’s underestimation of ENSO SST
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">anomalies.

<br>ENSO variability derived from a 1000-year simulation
<br>with the CSIRO Mark 2 coupled global climatic model.
<br>In common with most other current models, the present
<br>model underestimates the magnitude of the observed
<br>SST anomalies associated with ENSO events, but rep-
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">licates many of the critical features associated with
<br>ENSO-induced climatic variability. This is demonstrated
<br>by systematic comparisons with outputs
<br>from the
<br>NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set.

<br>gests that ENSO is a very robust feature of present cli-
<br>mate. Such stability does not preclude
<br>secular
<br>variability, as the SOI was shown to have a range of
<br>perturbations, with noticeable secular responses associ-
<br>ated with the occurrence of strong El Nin˜ o and La Nin˜ a
<br>events. Persistent ENSO events were found to be a
<br>natural outcome of the simulation, indicating that the
<br>observed, extended El Nin˜ o of the 1990s was not ex-
<br>ceptional. The simulation highlighted the role of the
<br>mixed layer ocean temperature anomalies in the devel-
<br>opment of ENSO events, and a better appreciation of
<br>the dynamics of such anomalies is clearly desirable.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:303px; top:11369px; width:243px; height:134px;"><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">While ENSO events are characterised by determinis-
<br>tic coupled atmospheric-oceanic modes, and such modes
<br>also appear to contribute to decadal variability, it is
<br>concluded that stochastic processes are the primary
<br>driver for the climatic variability displayed in the model.
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">This conclusion would appear to be ﬁrmly based given
<br></span><span style="font-family: AdvTimes; font-size:10px">the exclusion of all external forcing mechanisms from
<br>the simulation. Even if eventually it can be shown that
<br>deterministic coupled modes govern some observed
<br>decadal variability, the intra- and inter-decadal vari-
<br>ability associated with such modes would still indicate
<br>the importance of stochastic processes.
