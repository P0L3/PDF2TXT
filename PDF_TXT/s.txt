<br/>of an overall BEV charging infrastructure (Cruz-Zambrano et al., 2013;
<br/>Jochem et al., 2016; Schroeder and Traber, 2012). Indeed, Nilsson and
<br/>Nykvist (2016) investigated the near term interventions needed to
<br/>enable a BEV breakthrough over the next 15 years in the EU and
<br/>recognised that the availability of public fast charging is an important
<br/>signal for consumers and it will support BEV growth. Unlike conven-
<br/>tional slow charging stations that take hours to recharge a vehicle,
<br/>current 50 kW fast charging stations can recharge a BEV from an

<span style="font-family: AdvOT987ad488; font-size:7px">Many metrics exist to assess the individual predictor's importance

<span style="font-family: AdvOT987ad488; font-size:7px">cients

<br/>However, other methods for establishing predictor importance are
<br/>more accurate (Braun and Oswald, 2011; Calbick and Gunton, 2014)
<br/>and for this work, Lindeman, Merenda and Gold (lmg) method in the
<br/>Relaimpo package in R is used to assess predictor's importance
<br/>(Groemping, 2006). For this method, the relative importance of a

The transport sector is responsible globally for approximately one
quarter of the total energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, with over
70% of these emissions attributed to road transport. To reduce
transport related emissions, sustainable mobility plans of many
governments worldwide include the need for a substantial shift towards
the use of ultra-low carbon emission vehicles such as battery electric
vehicles (BEVs) (IEA, 2016; Sims, 2014). For instance, the Paris
Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate Change calls for the
global deployment of 100 million electric cars across all market
segments by 2030 (IEA, 2016; UNFCCC, 2015). However, recent
(2015) electric car stock ﬁgures have only reached 1.26 million1 cars
globally (IEA, 2016) indicating the need for a substantial market
growth. The low market share of BEVs is explained by several barriers
to adoption such as high purchasing cost compared to an equivalent
liquid-fuel vehicle, limited driving range and the lack of an appropriate
charging infrastructure. Policies are implemented in many countries to
increase the attractiveness of EVs and potentially their adoption rates
(Sierzchula et al., 2014; Silvia and Krause, 2016). These policy

Recent studies assessed the impact of policy mechanisms on EV
adoption. One important ﬁnding is that policy interventions may yield
diﬀerent impacts across diﬀerent groups of people (for example, early
adopters versus mainstream consumers), indicating the need for a
targeted intervention approach (Langbroek et al., 2016; Silvia and
Krause, 2016). In addition, Langbroek et al. (2016) found that access to
bus lanes and free parking are an eﬃcient alternative to expensive
subsidies; however, these kind of incentives must be in place tempora-
rily to avoid crowding (e.g. many cars in the bus lane) that can make
these policies less attractive and could also cause unwanted side eﬀects
(e.g. encourage driving instead of using public transport). Moreover,
the authors emphasised the importance of informative interventions
that could encourage more people to consider an EV, such as helping
people diﬀerentiate between their perceived and actual travel patterns.

Similarly, Silvia and Krause (2016) recognised the importance of
increasing awareness on EVs; moreover,
they found that policy
interventions perform considerably better when implemented syner-
gistically rather than in isolation. An awareness-related policy strategy
is described by Matthews et al. (2017); the authors analysed data
collected by trained mystery shoppers and demonstrated the impor-
tance for policy makers to recognise the inﬂuential role market
intermediaries such as car dealerships have in encouraging the adop-
tion of BEVs. An example of an awareness campaign is the new
national Go Ultra Low (GUL) campaign, a joint collaboration between
the UK government and vehicle stakeholders. GUL aims to increase
purchase consideration of EVs by helping potential users understand
the beneﬁts, cost savings and capabilities of available EV models on the
market (Go Ultra Low, 2017). While many studies found that the
presence of a public charging infrastructure is positively correlated
with EV adoption rates, it is important to note that the direction of
causality is not clear (Coﬀman et al., 2017; Mersky et al., 2016;
Sierzchula et al., 2014). Coﬀman et al. (2017) reviewed recent studies
assessing factors aﬀecting EV adoption and found that public charging
infrastructure is an important factor associated with EV uptake.
Speciﬁcally, Sierzchula et al. (2014) examined the relationship between
several socio-economic factors and 30 national EV market shares for
2012 and found that charging infrastructure was most strongly related
to EV adoption. Looking at the country with the highest market share
of EVs, Mersky et al. (2016) investigated the eﬀects of several
incentives on per capita EV sales in Norway and found that pricing
incentives and increased access to charging stations may be the best
policies to increase EV sales.

A public network of fast2 chargers is argued to be a key component
of an overall BEV charging infrastructure (Cruz-Zambrano et al., 2013;
Jochem et al., 2016; Schroeder and Traber, 2012). Indeed, Nilsson and
Nykvist (2016) investigated the near term interventions needed to
enable a BEV breakthrough over the next 15 years in the EU and
recognised that the availability of public fast charging is an important
signal for consumers and it will support BEV growth. Unlike conven-
tional slow charging stations that take hours to recharge a vehicle,
current 50 kW fast charging stations can recharge a BEV from an
empty battery to about 80% of full state of charge (SoC) in 20–30 min
(DBT, 2013). Fast charging is a relatively new technology that barely
existed for public use before 2013 (IEA, 2016) and it is of utmost
importance to measure the usage of this technology, understand
individuals’ behaviour, and provide actual evidence on the signiﬁcance
of this infrastructure. This can appropriately inform the expansion and
planning of the BEV charging infrastructure and inform subsequent
studies on the topic.

Using assumptions instead of real world behaviour datasets, some
studies assessed the business models for fast charging infrastructure to
guide prospective investment. Proﬁling charging demand is critical in
evaluating the proﬁtability of BEV fast charging infrastructure business
(Schroeder and Traber, 2012) and yet because of the lack of real-world
data, assumptions had to be used when assessing the business case for
this technology (Madina et al., 2016; Parasto Jabbari and Don
MacKenzie, 2016; Pierre Ducharme and Catherine Kargas, 2016;
Schroeder and Traber, 2012).

Similarly, some studies used assumptions instead of real BEV

the electricity grid. In particular, these studies assumed that all BEV
charging takes place on fast chargers and did not consider that BEVs
can be easily charged at home for most car owners (Jakobsson et al.,
2016). One study adapted the arrival time distribution of conventional
vehicles at petrol ﬁlling stations to determine a typical arrival time

ﬂicker) and actions such as deploying energy storage solutions need to
be taken in order to avoid these quality issues (Yunus et al., 2011).
Another study found that fast charging has the potential to quickly
overload local distribution equipment at peak times (Etezadi-Amoli
et al., 2010) and even cause failure in lines and transformers unless the
size and location of fast chargers are modiﬁed to avoid these impacts
(Sadeghi-Barzani et al., 2014).

Using real world datasets, one study investigated the impact of the
availability of fast charging on people's assessment of electromobility
and found that the participants’ attitudes towards BEVs improved
when they used a fast charger. While the results indicated the
importance of such an infrastructure in encouraging the uptake of
BEVs, they were based on an experiment that exposed 62 participants
who don’t own a BEV to a fast charge event (Gebauer et al., 2016).
Morrissey et al. (2016) analysed charging infrastructure data for the
whole of Ireland including 11,000 fast charge events from 83 fast
chargers. An interesting ﬁnding from the Irish study is that the mean
energy consumption for fast chargers at car parks was 7.27 kWh per
charge event which is similar to the mean recorded for standard public
car park chargers at 6.93 kWh. While Morrissey et al. (2016) provided
a preview of how BEV drivers are using fast chargers, their work did
not investigate if fast chargers have an impact on driving behaviour.

This paper has two objectives. The ﬁrst objective is to measure the
real world usage of fast chargers by analysing over 90,000 fast charge
events collected from the ﬁrst large-scale roll-outs and evaluation
projects of fast charging infrastructure to date in both the UK and the
US. Similar trends from two distinct geographical
locations were
identiﬁed. This could indicate the widespread applicability of the
results which may be transferable as lessons learnt to other geographic
locations and assist in the rollout of future infrastructure. In addition,
the ﬁndings based on real world datasets can inform theoretical
assumptions used on fast charging and assist in more robust ﬁndings
of subsequent studies on topics such as economic feasibility of fast
charge infrastructure and impact on the electricity networks.

The second objective is to explore the impact of fast chargers on
driving behaviour, speciﬁcally on driving distance, in order to evidence
the importance of fast chargers. This was done by analysing 18,000
charge events from all types of charging infrastructure and 67,000 trips
collected from data loggers installed in 35 BEVs that accessed and used
fast chargers.

(INEA, 2015) with the aim to cover Trans-European Transport
Network (TEN-T)3 roads with charging infrastructure. As such, the
location of the fast chargers were determined to ensure that these
strategic European roads (full length of Priority Project (PP) Road Axes
13 and 26 through the UK and into Ireland) are covered with BEV
charging infrastructure (Fig. 1). 76% of the RCN chargers were
installed at motorway service stations with the remaining points
installed at fuel ﬁlling stations, airports, seaports, Park and Rides,
hotels and large retail stores to enable a fully connected route covering
over 1000 km. The fast chargers were accessible to anyone with a BEV
and an access card. Data collected from each charging transaction
contained information on the start time of a charge event, duration and
energy transferred during the transaction. Due to privacy issues, the
dataset did not contain details on the network users. More details on
the RCN project can be found in the project ﬁnal report (Neaimeh et al.,

Over 62,000 fast charge events were collected from 106 fast
chargers (50 kW) over a period of 18 months between April 1, 2012
and September 30, 2013 in the US. The fast chargers were deployed as
part of The EV Project which was funded by the United States
Department of Energy
and
Reinvestment Act and private sector partners. The fast chargers were
located in and around the major metropolitan areas shown in Fig. 2.
Half of the chargers were in locations that could serve highway travel. A
charger was deemed capable of serving highway travel if it was less
than a one-mile drive from a highway. Since these chargers were also
located in metropolitan areas, it is expected that they are used for a
mixture of local travel and highway travel, but the exact proportion of
each is unknown. Anyone with a BEV capable of fast charging could use
the chargers. Similarly to the UK dataset, each charging transaction
collected from the US fast charge network contained information on
the start time of a charge event, duration and energy transferred.
Again, the dataset did not contain details on the users who used the fast
chargers. More information on The EV Project, the largest plug-in
electric vehicle infrastructure demonstration in the world, can be found
in this project report (Idaho National Lab, 2015).

charger was deemed capable of serving highway travel if it was less
than a one-mile drive from a highway. Since these chargers were also
located in metropolitan areas, it is expected that they are used for a
mixture of local travel and highway travel, but the exact proportion of
each is unknown. Anyone with a BEV capable of fast charging could use
the chargers. Similarly to the UK dataset, each charging transaction
collected from the US fast charge network contained information on
the start time of a charge event, duration and energy transferred.
Again, the dataset did not contain details on the users who used the fast
chargers. More information on The EV Project, the largest plug-in
electric vehicle infrastructure demonstration in the world, can be found
in this project report (Idaho National Lab, 2015).

2.2. Battery electric vehicles data collection (UK)


For in-depth monitoring of driving and charging behaviour beyond
what can be measured using the data from a fast charge network, high
resolution data were collected from a selected number of BEVs in the
UK. A 200GBP voucher was oﬀered to attract BEV drivers to participate
in the data collection and over 120 BEV drivers expressed interest in
participating. The 35 selected BEVs were privately owned and their
users were able to access the RCN fast chargers (i.e. live or work within
a BEV driving range of the network) and expressed that they will be
using the electric car as their primary vehicle. The participants owned
their vehicles for at least 3 months before data collection began to
ensure their familiarity with their BEV.

Age and income of the drivers participating in the BEV data
collection trial were compared to the UK population demographics,
and as expected the proﬁle of these drivers is similar to the proﬁle of
BEV early adopters. First, the age groups of the sample were compared
to the age groups of the UK population holding a valid driving license
(Department for Transport, 2016a; Oﬃce for National Statistics, 2016).
There were no participants younger than 21 years old (2% nationally),
10% were between 21 and 29 years old (15% nationally), 37% were
between 30 and 39 years old (17% nationally); 33% were between 40

income of the participants was compared to the average annual gross
income of all households grouped by quintiles (Oﬃce for National

where the national average gross income is 14,765 GBP. 6.5% of the

The cars of the participants comprised of 29 Nissan LEAFs (24kWh
battery, 200 km driving range) and 6 Renault ZOEs (22kWh battery,
240 km driving range). The advertised driving range of these vehicles
were obtained from laboratory testing and over-estimate real world
driving ranges. A realised driving range of a BEV is inﬂuenced by
factors such as speed and use of auxiliary power and it is estimated that
the realised range of a 24kWh LEAF won’t exceed 150 km (Neaimeh
et al., 2013; Needell et al., 2016). The cars were ﬁtted with data logging
devices (logger, GPRS and GPS antenna) to monitor driving and
charging behaviour of their users. These loggers provided up to second
by second data allowing the project to monitor how the vehicles were
driven, where and when they were charged and how much energy was
consumed. The data collected included the timestamp, GPS coordi-
nates, state of charge, speed of the vehicle, battery current, battery
voltage and ambient temperature. As an example, the GPS coordinates
collected during a trip were used to calculate the distance travelled. The
GPS coordinates during a charge event were used to determine the
location of this charge event (i.e. home, work, public, public-fast). In
more details, the charge events’ GPS information from the data loggers
was correlated with the addresses of any private location that the users
might charge at (e.g. home, work)4; and with the addresses of all the
public chargers in the UK using the information available in the
national charge point registry (OLEV, 2012). The data loggers collected
over 18,000 charge events (from all charging infrastructure) and
770,000 km driven in over 67,000 trips over a period of 18 month
between February 2015 and July 2016. In total, this resulted to around
12,700 driving days (a day when the vehicle was driven) with 12% of
these days included one or more fast charge event. The users
contributed a similar number of driving days each, with an average
of 3% driving days per participant and a standard deviation of 0.67%.
More information on the driving and charging patterns of the users
is presented. On average, the users drove on 83% of the days during the
trial (i.e. almost 6 days per week) and the standard deviation was 11%.

users grouped in boxplots. The boxplots compactly display the dis-
tribution of daily distances. The bottom edge of the box is the 25th

in order to ensure that this small number relative to the remainder of
the data did not have a disproportionately high inﬂuence on the
regression analysis, robust regression was explored. Ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression can be sensitive to unusual data (e.g. outliers
and high leverage points). Robust regression is an alternative to OLS
regression when the data contain potentially inﬂuential observations.
The robust regression is done by iterated re-weighted least squares
(IRLS) and the idea is to down-weight or ignore unusual data (Fox and
Weisberg, 2010). These data points were deemed valid and were not
data entry errors, nor were they from a diﬀerent population than most
of our data.5 Therefore, we had no compelling reason to exclude them
from the analysis. In this work, the robust regression implements M-
estimation with Huber weighting where observations with small
residuals get a weight of 1 and the larger the residual, the smaller
the weight (Faraway, 2016; Fox and Weisberg, 2010).

3.1. Energy transferred during fast charge events

3.1. Energy transferred during fast charge events


The distribution of AC charging energy from the RCN chargers is
shown in Fig. 7 (top). The AC kWh numbers correspond to how much
energy was drawn from the grid (AC). The amount of energy delivered
to the vehicles’ batteries was not collected, but it could be estimated to
be around 90% of the AC energy from the grid, due to charger
ineﬃciency (Idaho National Lab, 2016). In the UK, the average and
median energy transferred per charge event were 9.2 AC kWh and 7.9
AC kWh respectively. The average and median energy used per charge
event from EV Project fast chargers were 9.2 and 9.3 AC kWh
respectively. The distribution of AC charging energy from EV Project
chargers is shown in Fig. 7 (bottom). The results from the US and the
UK show similar trends and corroborate the ﬁndings from the Irish fast
charge network roll-out that found that the average fast charge energy
consumption is 8.32kWh (Morrissey et al., 2016). These results show
that typical energy transfer on fast chargers is approximately half of the
vehicle battery capacity.6 It is worth noting that the amount of energy
transferred is dependent on duration of charging and initial battery
state of charge, due to the fact that at higher state of charge, charging
power will decrease (Idaho National Lab, 2016).

The distribution of actual energy usage on fast chargers is sig-
niﬁcant for subsequent studies investigating the impact of fast charging
on the electricity grid and studies developing a business case for such
an infrastructure and would need to be aware of the ranges of energy
used per charging transaction. As an example, the queue model
developed by Parasto Jabbari and MacKenzie (2016) to investigate
operators’ cost and access reliability of fast chargers could result in
more accurate ﬁndings if the authors used real data instead of having to
assume that each vehicle's energy usage is 20 kWh per charge event.
Similarly, assuming a full charge of the vehicle on fast chargers
(Etezadi-Amoli et al., 2010; Sadeghi-Barzani et al., 2014; Yunus
et al., 2011) instead of using measured data can result in overestimat-
ing the impacts on the electricity grid.

paper is to analyse the driving distance of a group of BEV users who
had access and used fast chargers. In addition to some descriptive
analysis, multiple linear regression was conducted for a more detailed
study on the driving behaviour of these BEV drivers. For the regression,
the outcome variable was daily distance and the predictors were daily
standard charge and fast charge energy. Multiple regression is used in
two distinct applications: prediction and explanation (Courville and
Thompson, 2001; Faraway, 2016). For this work, the more interesting
use of multiple regression is for the explanation of the contribution of
each predictor (standard charge energy, fast charge energy) to daily
distance. This allows the identiﬁcation of which predictor is relatively
more important than the other- which what is typically meant by the
relative importance of predictors in multiple regression (Johnson and

in a model. A most typical approach of assessing importance is to
examine the magnitude of the standardized regression coeﬃcients
associated with each predictor, where predictors with larger coeﬃcients
are viewed as more important than those with smaller weights.
However, other methods for establishing predictor importance are
more accurate (Braun and Oswald, 2011; Calbick and Gunton, 2014)
and for this work, Lindeman, Merenda and Gold (lmg) method in the
Relaimpo package in R is used to assess predictor's importance
(Groemping, 2006). For this method, the relative importance of a
predictor is deﬁned as the proportionate contribution each predictor in
a linear multiple regression model makes to the model coeﬃcient of
multiple determination, R2, considering both the unique contribution
of each predictor by itself and its incremental contribution when
combined with the other predictors (Groemping, 2006; Johnson and
Lebreton, 2004). All the relative R2 sum to the model R2.

Since the collection of new (or fresh) data from the BEV users
beyond the trial period was not possible, resampling was used instead
to investigate the model's performance. Resampling methods can
produce reasonable predictions of how well the model will perform
on future data (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013). Resampling consists of
using a subset of the data to ﬁt a model and using the remaining data to
estimate the eﬃcacy of the model. This process is repeated many times
and the results are aggregated and summarised (Kuhn and Johnson,
2013). The resampling method used in this work is called “repeated 10-
fold cross-validation” where the dataset is randomly partitioned into 10
sets of roughly equal size. A model is ﬁt using all the dataset except for
the ﬁrst set (called the ﬁrst fold). The data points in this ﬁrst set (i.e.
daily distance) are predicted by this model and used to estimate
performance measures (e.g. R2). The ﬁrst set is returned to the dataset
and the process repeats with the second set held out and so on until the
tenth set. The 10 resampled estimates of performance are summarised
usually with the mean and standard error (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013).

median and mean duration of 21 and 22 min, respectively, and 21% of
charges are longer than 30 min. After 30 min of charging on a fast
charger, the vehicle battery will often be close to fully charged and
charging will occur at a much slower rate to completely charge the
battery. Long charges can severely impact charger availability and it is
suggested that limiting the duration of a charge event could provide
fairer access to the charger and reduce waiting times. Another
alternative would be to introduce a rate structure for the charge event
payment where it becomes more expensive after 30 min. In general,
there is a need to decrease the uncertainties associated with the
availability of
fast charge infrastructure to allow journeys to be

While both datasets show a similar trend, there are some diﬀer-
ences that can be noticed between the UK and the US. Much of these
diﬀerences can likely be attributed to the diﬀerence in vehicles capable
of using fast chargers, notably the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV. The
Outlander PHEV, a plug-in hybrid, is one of the most popular plug-in
vehicles available in Europe, and it is not sold in the United States at
the time of this writing. A full charge for the Outlander is 9.8 kWh,
which is approximately half the capacity of most BEVs in the United
States. The Outlander can be fast charged for an 80% charge (up to
7.8kWh) in approximately 25 min (Mitsubishi UK, 2017). Fast char-
ging of this vehicle likely contributes to a large number of events from
the RCN with energy between 6 and 8kWh (over 20% of the UK
dataset) and the associated 20–25 min charging duration. Many of the
RCN participants had recommended discouraging unnecessary usage
of the fast chargers by plug-in hybrids with small batteries and internal
combustion engines due to the fact that BEV users might need them
more urgently.

Finally, fast chargers in the RCN and The EV Project have similar
usage proﬁles. As expected, the majority of fast charge events took
place during the day. Over 50% of charges began between 11:00 and
18:00, and very little use occurred between midnight and 6 A.M.
(Fig. 9). The vertical lines on the graphs delimit 50% of the data.
Similarly to the importance of information on energy transferred,

studies and signiﬁcant for studies trying to develop a business case, as
revenue generation opportunities will vary throughout the day.

The analysis in this section is based on a group of 35 BEV drivers

associated with these 35 drivers were analysed with 12% of these days
included one or more fast charge event and in total 11.9% of the total
charging energy was transferred on fast chargers (Fig. 6). At ﬁrst, the

fast charge events is shown in Fig. 10. The graph displays the mean
daily distance at diﬀerent numbers of fast charge events performed in a

charging infrastructure multiple times and it can be appreciated that
the relationship between fast charging and increased daily distance is
obvious. Similarly, the positive relationship between driving distance

The graphical exploration of the data in Section 4.1 indicated a
relationship between fast charging and increased driving distance. A
robust analysis of this relationship is carried out using multiple
regression where daily distance is predicted from standard charge
energy and fast charge energy. The regression results, described in the
following sections, showed that both predictors have a statistically
signiﬁcant and positive eﬀect on daily distance at over 95% conﬁdence
level (see Table 2) and fast charging was determined to be more
inﬂuential than slow charging.

A few observations with either high leverage or large residuals were
identiﬁed as possibly problematic to the model. The mean daily
distance for these observations was 430 km. Robust regression was
carried out to deal with these potentially inﬂuential observations that
could be problematic when using a simple ordinary least squares
regression. Fig. 12 shows that the predicted values from the linear
model and the predicted values from the robust linear model fall on a
straight line indicating the similarities between the models, also
evident in Table 1. The R2 statistic is not given in the context of a
robust regression (Faraway, 2016). The results of the robust regression
were similar to the OLS regression (Fig. 12, Table 1) and as such, the
analysis in this work will be based on the OLS linear model.

how much of the variability in the outcome is accounted for by the
predictors. For this model, the adjusted R2 = 0.64 and as such 64% of
variation in daily distance can be explained by daily standard and fast
charge energy. This also means that 36% of the variation in daily
distance cannot be explained by daily charging energy alone. Second,
we look at the value of the F-ratio that indicate how much variability
the model can explain relative to how much it can’t explain. A good
model should have a large F-ratio value and the statistical signiﬁcance
of this value should be assessed. For this dataset F is 11,180, which is
signiﬁcant at p-value < 0.001. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
regression model results in signiﬁcantly better prediction of daily
distance than if we used the mean value of daily distance. In other
words, the 64% of variance that can be explained is a signiﬁcant
amount. In short, this regression model overall predicts daily distance

In the context of linear regression, the variance inﬂation factor (VIF)
can be used to diagnose multicollinearity. The VIF indicates if there is a
strong correlation between the predictors. If there is multicollinearity then
the coeﬃcient values are untrustworthy and makes it diﬃcult to assess the
individual importance of a predictor (Field et al., 2012). The square root
VIF values of the predictors is 1.000027 ( < 2) indicating that there is no
multicollinearity between standard and fast charge energy.

4.2.3. Relative importance of fast and standard charge energy


It is interesting to look at the individual contribution of the
predictors (standard charge, fast charge) in the model and identify
which predictor makes a greater contribution to daily distance. The
results of the analysis indicated that fast charge energy most inﬂuence
daily distance, explaining about 46% of the observed variation, while
standard charge energy explains 18% of the variation. The sum of the
proportionate contribution of each predictor is equal to the total R2 of
the model (64%). Thus, fast charge energy is about 2.5 times as
important as standard charge energy in predicting daily distance for
BEV users who have access and use fast chargers.

Furthermore, the model R2 and the proportionate contribution of
each predictor to R2 was investigated in an incremental approach. The
contribution of each predictor was measured at incremental daily
distance values of 50 km, starting with daily distance up to 50 km per
day and going to up to 600 km per day. The results are shown in
Fig. 13. The values of proportionate R2 at daily distance (up to) 600 km
correspond to the values for the whole dataset.

It can be noticed that standard charge energy is more important
than fast charge energy up to daily distance=240 km. After 240 km, fast
charge energy becomes more important. The ﬁndings from this multi-
ple regression model, looking at the relative importance of predictors,
demonstrate the importance of
fast chargers in enabling driving
distances beyond the single-charge range of a BEV. In other words,
fast chargers become more important the farther we drive; their
availability extended the BEV driving range and enabled driving
distances that would have been otherwise impractical using standard
(slow) chargers with associated long recharging times.

demonstrate the importance of
fast chargers in enabling driving
distances beyond the single-charge range of a BEV. In other words,
fast chargers become more important the farther we drive; their
availability extended the BEV driving range and enabled driving







distances that would have been otherwise impractical using standard


(slow) chargers with associated long recharging times.


In this work, the regression model's R2 is 0.64 which means that
almost 2/3 of the variation in daily distance is explained by daily
standard and fast charging. In addition,
fast chargers are more
inﬂuential than slow chargers (higher contribution to R2) and they
start to become more important for journeys that are above 240 km per
day. Yet, journeys above 240 km per day are rare, 1.5% were recorded
on the RCN trial and 2% were recorded in the UK NTS dataset
(Department for Transport, 2015a). It is clear then that the majority
of daily driving can be met with current BEV models and standard slow
chargers at private locations (i.e. home or work). This is aligned with
previous studies that conﬁrmed the suitability of existing BEV models
to meet almost all of the users’ daily travelling needs (Greaves et al.,
2014; Needell et al., 2016; Pearre et al., 2011), even if relying only on
slow night-time charging, suggesting that the BEV range is primarily a
psychological barrier (Franke et al., 2012; Needell et al., 2016).

While this raises the question on whether a fast charge infrastruc-
ture is required, especially that it is expensive to install, it is important
that policy makers don’t interpret actual daily distance requirements as
evidence against supporting the roll-out of a fast charge infrastructure.
Without fast chargers, the transition from liquid-fuel vehicles to
BEVs will be aﬀected. First, it may be possible to overcome perceived
range barriers with fast chargers. Fast chargers could provide assur-
ance and comfort to reduce range anxiety and the perceived unsuit-
ability of BEVs beyond short city driving. Second, fast chargers can add
range quickly into a BEV to make the occasional long journeys possible.
Consequently, a network of fast chargers might help overcome both
these perceived and actual range barriers, making BEVs more attractive
to potential buyers and helping to increase their adoption rates. We
expand on both these points in the following paragraphs.

Driver range anxiety is the fear of depleting the battery and
therefore lack suﬃcient range to complete a trip. Range anxiety can
lead to underutilizing the available range and limit the number of miles
travelled in a BEV, even when the BEV is capable of adequately
completing the required journey (Egbue and Long, 2012; Jensen et al.,
2014; Neubauer and Wood, 2014). This reduces the utility of BEVs that
are then considered only suitable for short city driving and unsuitable
for long journeys (Greaves et al., 2014). However, this paper provided
evidence that drivers are using their BEVs to go on long journeys that
are above the single-charge range of the vehicle and fast chargers were
used to enable these long journeys. This indicates the importance of
fast charge infrastructure because their availability, and usage, allowed
drivers to use a limited-range car on long journeys thought only
possible using conventional liquid-fuel vehicles. These results are not
intended to demonstrate that fast chargers promote or encourage long
journeys; but instead that fast chargers enable long journeys that would
have been impractical,
if not impossible, using conventional slow
chargers with associated long recharging times. The fast chargers

the daily driving distances
presented in this paper are based on a sample of 35 drivers that might

Second, when a car purchase is made, the customer wants to be able
to make all their journeys, not just the majority of their journeys
(Kempton, 2016). Even with BEVs with increased battery capacities
(e.g. Chevrolet Bolt), a remaining small number of driving days won’t
be met without recharging (Needell et al., 2016). In addition, not every
household has access to an additional vehicle that will allow the
occasional long journeys; in England, only one third of the households
have access to two or more cars (Department for Transport, 2016a). A
network of fast chargers could enable the occasional long journeys with
limited time spent charging (for example, during a typical rest stop).

Consequently, developing the BEV market to reduce emissions from
road transport could be predicated on the availability of a fast charge
network. Road transport accounts for 21% of the country's CO2
emissions and most of these emissions come from cars and light vans
(Department for Transport, 2016b). The total distance travelled by cars
and light vans in 2015 was 475 billion kilometres. It is worth noting
that the Strategic Road Network, where the RCN chargers are installed,
carried 144 billion kilometres in 2015, almost one-third of all
motorised traﬃc in England (Department for Transport, 2017). Road
traﬃc is expected to rise in the coming years, predominately because of
the projected growth in the population levels, and this growth is
expected to be particularly strong on the Strategic Road Network,
between 29–60% from 2010 to 2040 (Department for Transport,
2015b). During the period of study, The 51 RCN chargers delivered
around 300 MWh of energy that approximately equates to 1.65 million
electric kilometres driven.7 The RCN network operator is a renewable
energy electricity company that generates and supplies near-zero
carbon emission electricity (Ecotricity, 2015). As such, the RCN net-
work has saved 230 t of CO2 when compared against the emissions
which could have been produced by new registered cars (140 g CO2/
km) (Department for Transport, 2015c). Expanding the fast charge
infrastructure on road networks that carry a signiﬁcant share of
motorised traﬃc can support the electriﬁcation of kilometres driven
on these roads and contribute to meeting decarbonisation goals.

Governments and car manufacturers have ﬁnanced the majority of
the current pilot deployments of fast chargers (Ducharme and Kargas,
2016). Nonetheless, ﬁnding a proﬁtable business case for future
investment in fast charging is becoming imperative as government or
automakers ﬁnancial support of fast charging is unlikely to continue
forever. Yet, at current BEV market share, fast charge networks might
not be proﬁtable in the near-term (Madina et al., 2016; Schroeder and
Traber, 2012) to encourage private investment. This is a particular
political challenge as withdrawing the ﬁnancial support for the fast
charge infrastructure too early, before the market and rates of BEV
adoption have matured to a point where this support is no longer
needed, could severely inhibit the growth in BEV numbers. As an

Data from the ﬁrst large-scale roll-outs and evaluation projects of
fast charging infrastructure and BEVs have been analysed to measure
actual usage of fast chargers and demonstrate their importance in the
overall BEV charging infrastructure. The ﬁndings from this work can
inform subsequent studies on the topic and help shape the planning
and deployment of future charging networks.

The data from the fast charge networks showed that a typical energy
transfer from fast chargers is approximately half of the vehicle battery
capacity (Section 3.1). The majority of fast charging took place during
the day with over 50% of the events began between 11:00 and 18:00
(Section 3.2). The analysis of energy data in the UK suggested a
substantial usage of the fast charge infrastructure by plug-in-hybrids.
These cars have a smaller battery to provide electric operation and a
combustion engine to extend their vehicle range. This means that plug-
in hybrid drivers don’t need to rely on charging infrastructure to
complete their journeys. As such, it may be necessary to ensure that
battery electric cars have a priority over plug-in-hybrids in using the
fast charge infrastructure that can be essential for BEVs to complete
their journeys. This ﬁnding is especially relevant for the fast charge
network operators in the US considering the planned introduction of
the plug-in Outlander, though it is not clear yet if the US model will be
capable of fast charging (Mitsubishi U.S., 2017).

In terms of transaction duration, 32% of the events in the UK and
21% of the events in the US were above 30 min (Section 3.2). The
charging rate slows down when the battery is close to full resulting in
long charge events that impact the charger availability. Policies that
would encourage the development and the enforcement of Information
and communications technology (ICT) solutions for charging manage-
ment can help reduce waiting time and queuing at the charging
stations. Some of the proposed solutions include a charger reservation
system (Zhang et al., 2015) or a platform that sends text messages to
inform drivers that they had reached the maximum allowable time
allocation on the fast charger (SmartCEM, 2015).

Actual trip and charging event data of BEV owners over a period of
18 months were used to carry out an explorative multiple regression.
The analysis examined the relationship between daily distance and
standard and fast charging and showed that both predictors have a
statistically signiﬁcant and positive eﬀect on daily distance. The relative
importance of the predictors in the regression model was calculated
and fast charging was determined to be more inﬂuential than standard
charging.

The fast charge infrastructure provision is expensive and its
utilisation levels are going to be low in the coming few years
(Jochem et al., 2016) which is not appealing to private investors.
Policy makers will have to make a judgement on the costs of supporting
the early development of this infrastructure and the associated adop-
tion rates and emissions’ beneﬁts. Evidence from this work can be used
to justify decisions to dedicate some funding to speciﬁcally support fast
chargers, at least initially, while it is still not attractive for investors.

In 2015, 65% of the 28,000 fast chargers installed worldwide were
located in China and Japan while these two countries accounted for

more and more customers to opt for a battery electric vehicle and there
is a vital need to accelerate the development of fast charge networks.
