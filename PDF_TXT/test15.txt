The impact of the updated SOP on short-range forecasts is investigated using a global atmospheric forecast model applied to a heavy snowfall event over Korea on 4 January 2010. When the SOP is updated, the orographic drag in the lower troposphere noticeably increases owing to the additional FBD over mountainous regions. The enhanced drag directly weakens the excessive wind speed in the low troposphere and indirectly improves the temperature and mass elds over East Asia. In addition, the snowfall overestimation over Korea is improved by the reduced heat uxes from the surface. The forecast improvements are robust regardless of the horizontal resolution of the model between T126 and T510. The parameterization is statistically evaluated based on the skill of the medium-range forecasts for February 2014. For the medium-range forecasts, the skill improvements of the wind speed and temperature in the low troposphere are observed globally and for East Asia while both positive and negative effects appear indirectly in the middle-upper troposphere. The statistical skill for the precipitation is mostly improved due to the improvements in the synoptic elds. The improvements are also found for seasonal simulation throughout the troposphere and stratosphere during boreal winter. The parameterization of the effects of subgrid-scale orography in global numerical weather prediction and climate models is crucial for successful weather and climate predictions [e.g., Palmer et al., 1986; Miller et al., 1989]. Subgrid orographic parameterizations (SOPs) describe the transport of momentum induced by subgrid-scale orography to large-scale ow. Considerable efforts have been made to more realistically parameterize this orography-induced force (i.e., subgrid orographic drag) (for a review, see Kim et al. [2003] and Alexander et al. [2010]). In general, subgrid orographic drag is classi ed into three types: Drag due to gravity waves (GWs), low-level wave breaking, and ow blocking [ Zadra et al., 2003, Figure 1; Kim and Doyle , 2005]. The GWs generated by ow over mountains propagate vertically and produce drag at upper levels when breaking, which is known as GW drag (GWD). The low-level breaking and trapped leewaves downstream can enhance drag in the lower troposphere. The ow-blocking drag (FBD) is forced by ow blocked on the mountain anks or owing around the mountain under upstream stable conditions, providing drag near the surface, where the blocking occurs. Initially, SOPs concentrated mainly on parameterizing the effects of GWD and were based on the twodimensional (2-D) linear GW theory for an idealized mountain [e.g., Boer et al., 1984; McFarlane , 1987]. The GWD parameterizations led to substantial improvements in lower stratosphere and troposphere simulations, such as the separation of the subtropical and polar night jets and the alleviation of the surface westerlies [ Palmer et al., 1986]. Since then, SOPs have been improved to include more sophisticated orographic effects, such as the aforementioned low-level wave breaking [e.g., Kim and Arakawa , 1995; Hong et al., 2008] and ow blocking [e.g., Lott and Miller , 1997; Scinocca and McFarlane , 2000; Webster et al., 2003; Kim and Doyle , 2005], as well as orographic speci cations, such as orographic anisotropy [e.g., Gregory et al., 1998; Scinocca and McFarlane , 2000; Kim and Doyle , 2005]. The inclusion of drag effects enhanced by low-level wave breaking improved the forecasts of weather phenomena, such as extra tropical cyclones [ Hong et al., 2008] and climate simulations [ Kim , 1996; Gregory et al., 1998]. The FBD parameterizations improved the simulations of the wind elds over the troposphere and lower stratosphere [ Zadra et al., 2003] and other elds indirectly affected, such as precipitation [ Zhong and Chen , 2015]. CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,445 In this study, the SOP from Hong et al. [2008] based on Kim and Arakawa [1995] implemented in the Global/Regional Integrated Model system (GRIMs), including the drag effects associated with 2-D GWs and low-level wave breaking, is updated by including the effects of 3-D orographic anisotropy and FBD. The impact of the updated SOP on short-range forecasts is investigated for a heavy snowfall event over East Asia using the GRIMs global model program (GMP). The parameterization is statistically evaluated based on the skill of medium-range forecasts, and its impacts on seasonal simulations are also examined during boreal winter. One may argue that the SOP used in this study is out of date. However, it is natural to revise an existing physics component on a well-established forecast model such as the GRIMs. Thus, our starting point is the GWD from Hong et al. [2008] and FBD based on the Kim and Doyle [2005]. In addition, several modi cations/new formulations are introduced to both GWD and FBD. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the model, SOP, and experimental design; section 3 presents the impact of the updated SOP on shortand medium-range forecasts and seasonal simulations; and section 4 presents a summary and conclusions. The model used in this study is the GRIMs-GMP [ Hong et al., 2013] based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction seasonal forecast model [ Kanamitsu et al., 2002]. The GRIMs has been developed for numerical weather prediction, seasonal forecasts, and climate research projects for global-regional scales with improved model dynamics and physics. The model includes two options in the dynamical core (spherical harmonics and double Fourier series) and multiple options for each physics parameterization. In this study, we utilize the spherical harmonics dynamical core, which is widely used in global atmospheric models with high numerical accuracy and stability, and the physics package according to Table 1 from Hong et al. [2013] with several minor revisions (e.g., the deep convective scheme from Lim et al. [2014]). The SOP scheme is updated as described in the next subsection. The GRIMs uses the SOP from Hong et al. [2008] based on Kim and Arakawa [1995], which includes the effects of the GWD and the drag due to low-level wave breaking and nonhydrostatic wave trapping (OGWD). In this study, the parameterization is updated by also including the effects of orographic anisotropy and the FBD. First, the formulations for the OGWD parameterization are extended to include the effects of orographic anisotropy according to Kim and Doyle [2005]. To achieve this, the orographic direction (OD), which is equivalent to the horizontal aspect ratio of the orography, is introduced as OD L L (1) where L is the effective orographic length, which represents the subgrid-scale mountain width in the direction of low-level wind measured at the critical orographic height. The L denotes L for the cross-wind direction. The Froude number, one of the factors that determines the GW stress at a reference level, is then rede ned through multiplication with OD as follows: N U where h is the orographic height, which is de ned as the standard deviation of subgrid-scale orography; N is the low-level Brunt-Väisälä frequency; and U is the low-level horizontal wind speed. The GW stress ( ) at the reference level is given as follows: Fr h OD (2) E m G U N E OA 2 m 1 L G Fr C OC Fr (3) (4) where is the low-level density; E is the enhancement factor for representing the nonlinear enhancement of drag due to the low-level wave breaking, which is calculated by the orographic asymmetry (OA), which CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,446 represents the shape and location of subgrid-scale orography relative to the grid and the Fr normalized by its critical value ( Fr = 1); m is the number of subgrid-scale orography; is the effective grid length; G is an asymptotic function that provides a smooth transition between the nonblocking and blocking cases and includes the effect of orographic convexity (OC) corresponding to the vertical orographic aspect ratio; and C and C are set to 0.8 and 0.5, respectively, based on the mesoscale simulation results from Kim and Arakawa [1995]. A more detailed description is given by Kim and Doyle [2005]. The GW stress is the same as that of Hong et al. [2008] except for the Fr , including the effect of OD and a free parameter, . In Hong et al. [2008], the was practically set to the grid length with a minimum limit of 50 km, whereas in this study, it is set to twice the grid length without the limit. The updated has little effect on the shortand medium-range forecasts but gives slightly better seasonal forecast skills. Second, the FBD effects are included in the OGWD parameterization. The ow-blocking stress is given as follows: 1 2 m C L h U (5) wind direction, and h is the height of the blocked layer. The FBD parameterization generally follows the study of Kim and Doyle [2005], except for the h and C . Kim and Doyle [2005] de ne h as a function of the Froude number , whereas we determine it according to the dividing streamline theory [ Snyder et al., 1985; Etling , 1989], as in Zhong and Chen [2015], who state that the blocked layer occurs when the potential energy exceeds the kinetic energy. Thus, h is found by solving the following equation: Fr Fr 0 N z H z d z U h 2 (6) where H is the maximum height of the actual subgrid orography within each grid box and N and U are the basic-state static stability and wind, respectively. C is theoretically set to 1 by Kim and Doyle [2005], but this is inconsistent with the observations, which show its orographic aspect ratio dependence [ Batchelor , 1967]. Therefore, according to Lott and Miller [1997], we calculate C as a function of OD: C max 2 1 OD 0 (7) C is approximately 1 for isotropic orography, 2 for ow orthogonal to an elongated orography, and 0 for ow along an elongated orography. Shortand medium-range forecasts and seasonal simulations are performed using the GRIMs-GMP with original (CTL experiment) and updated (SOP experiment) SOPs. Because the effects of SOP are signi cant mainly in winter, as in previous studies [e.g., Zadra et al., 2003] we focus on high-impact weather, such as heavy snowfall events over South Korea during boreal winter. For the short-range forecasts, a recordbreaking heavy snowfall event that occurred over South Korea on 4 January 2010 is selected, and the impact of the updated SOP on the synoptic elds and precipitation is investigated by comparing the SOP and CTL results. The model is integrated for 48 h, starting from 00:00 UTC 3 January 2010, using initial and boundary conditions from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis [ Kanamitsu , 1989]. We focus on the model results with a resolution of T510L64. The effects of the updated SOP on the horizontal resolution are investigated by comparing the experiments with T126, T254, and T510 resolutions, which correspond to the grid spacing of approximately 100, 50, and 25 km, respectively. We also perform the following four additional experiments to investigate the individual impacts of the factors updated in SOP: (i) An SOPA experiment with the orographic anisotropy effect only, (ii) an SOPF experiment with the ow-blocking drag effect only, (iii) SOPH, and (iv) SOPB experiments that are the same as the SOP experiment except for the use of the original height of the blocked layer (i.e., h 0) and bulk drag coef cient (i.e., C = 1), respectively. F F For the medium-range forecasts, 28-member ensembles of 10 day forecasts at a resolution of T214L64 are performed using initial and boundary data from the NCEP GFS analysis for every 00:00 UTC in February 2014, CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,447 when an anomalously long-lasting heavy snowfall event over South Korea occurred. The medium-range forecasts with a number of members are performed at a lower horizontal resolution (T214) compared with the short-range forecasts (T510) because of the limited computational resources. The synoptic features from the CTL and SOP experiments are statistically evaluated based on the forecast skill regarding the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the simulated wind speed and temperature computed against the radiosonde data. The seasonal simulations consisting of ve-member ensembles are performed for the boreal winter from December February (DJF) in the years 2013 2014 when the seasonal mean states are shown to be similar to climatology under the normal sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The ensemble runs are initialized at 0000 UTC 1 5 November with initial conditions derived from the NCEP GFS analysis data. As for the surface boundary condition, Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature data [ Reynolds et al., 2007] are used. The horizontal resolution of the model for the seasonal simulation is T126, and the vertical resolution is the same as that for the shortand medium-range forecasts. Through the comparison between the seasonal simulations for the CTL and SOP experiments, the impacts of the updated SOP on the seasonal predictability of zonal mean zonal wind and temperature, stationary eddy, and precipitation are examined. Figures 1a and 1b show the subgrid orographic drag d U d t d V d t averaged over East Asia (25° 50°N and 105° 145°E) from the CTL and SOP experiments during the 48 h forecast (00:00 UTC 3 5 January 2010) for a heavy snowfall event over Korea. The comparison between the two experiments shows that the CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,448 orographic drag clearly increases (more than fourfold) in the low troposphere when the SOP is updated. The orographic drag in the middle upper troposphere is slightly decreased by the reduced OGWD, though not as signi cantly as for the low troposphere. Figures 1c and 1d show the biases and RMSEs of the wind speed averaged over the East Asian continent from the CTL and SOP experiments. The skill scores are calculated through comparison with the NCEP Final Analysis (FNL) data, which is presented on 1° × 1° grids for every 6 h. The results demonstrate that the enhanced drag in the low troposphere from the SOP experiment alleviates the low-tropospheric wind speed overestimation over the East Asian continent from the CTL experiment. Note that the orographic drag has an opposite sign to the wind, causing its deceleration. Its magnitude is shown in Figures 1a and 1b. The wind reduction in the low troposphere improves the forecast skills for the lowtropospheric wind, with a substantially reduced bias and RMSE for the SOP experiment. However, the updated orographic drag induces negative effects (i.e., degradation of skills) indirectly in some regions, especially in the middle-upper troposphere in spite of the small magnitude of the drag. The de ciency may need to be improved by considering the interaction with other processes, which will be studied further in the future. To understand the effects by updating the SOP, the individual impacts of each updated factor (i.e., orographic anisotropy, ow-blocking drag, height of the blocked layer, and bulk drag coef cient) are investigated in Figure 2, which show the orographic drag from the SOPA, SOPF, SOPH, and SOPB experiments, respectively. Figures 2a and 2b indicate that the reduced (enhanced) drag in the middle-upper (low) troposphere from the SOP experiment shown in Figure 1 is mainly because of the orographic anisotropy (additional ow-blocking drag). The orographic drag in the SOPH experiment with the original h is much smaller in the low troposphere than when the updated one is used. This is because the condition causing the owblocking effects (i.e., F F 0) is rarely met, and the magnitude of the h , which is one of factors that determines the magnitude of FBD, is smaller when the original h is used. The smaller drag in the SOPH experiment, in turn, leads to less wind improvement in the low troposphere. The orographic drag in the SOPB experiment is similar to that in the SOP experiment, implying that the ow-blocking effects on the short-range forecasts over East Asia are less sensitive to the C . CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,449 The updated SOP does affect not only the wind but also other elds indirectly. Figure 3a shows the bias and RMSE of the average temperature over East Asia from the CTL experiment during the 48 h forecast, with cold (warm) biases for the low middle (middle upper) troposphere. The biases and RMSE increase with increasing forecast time, and the skill scores are worse for the low troposphere than for the middle upper troposphere. Figure 3b shows the differences in the bias and RMSE of the temperatures from the SOP and CTL experiments. The bias difference (temperature difference) between the two experiments shows that the temperature in the low (middle upper) troposphere is higher (lower) in the SOP than in the CTL experiment. The temperature differences are mostly out of phase with the CTL experiment biases, indicating their reduction in the SOP experiment. This bias reduction is particularly noticeable for the low troposphere, where the wind bias is substantially reduced by the enhanced orographic drag. Skill improvements are also found for the RMSE. The temperature changes can be explained partly by the thermal wind relationship. In the low troposphere, the reduced wind in the SOP experiment causes a weakened horizontal gradient in temperature, which corresponds to warming over East Asia. This low-tropospheric warming expands the air mass responsible for the increase in geopotential height (Figure 3d). The positive differences in geopotential height indicate that the negative bias of the geopotential height in the CTL experiment (Figure 3c) is reduced in the SOP experiment. Skill improvements are found for the RMSE and bias. Although we focus on East Asia, the improvements in the wind, temperature, and geopotential height through updating the SOP are shown worldwide, except for in the summer hemisphere (not shown). The improvements in the synoptic elds positively affect the precipitation forecast. Figure 4 shows the snowfall from the rain gauge observations and the CTL and SOP experiment simulations accumulated for 12 h (1800 UTC 3 January and 0600 UTC 4 January 2010), which nearly corresponds to the rainy period CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,450 over Korea. In Seoul (~37.5°N, ~127°E), heavy snowfall is observed with an accumulation of 28.5 mm. This is well-reproduced by the CTL and SOP experiments, although the maximum magnitude is underestimated. However, the overall snowfall is overestimated in the CTL experiment, especially around Pohang (~36°N, ~129.5°E), but improved in the SOP simulation by the reduced heat uxes from the surface due to the decreased turbulent exchange coef cients resulting from the weakened surface wind. The improvement also can be induced dynamically by the reduced orographic lifting due to the reduced low-level wind. The dependence of the effects of the updated SOP on the horizontal resolution of the model is investigated. Figure 5 shows the times series of the biases and RMSEs of the 10 m wind speed averaged over East Asia for the 48 h forecast (heavy snowfall event, 00:00 UTC, 3 5 January 2012) from the CTL and SOP experiments at resolutions of T126, T254, and T510. The skill scores from both experiments are computed against the FNL data. For the CTL experiment, the 10 m wind speed is overestimated compared with the FNL, and the positive biases are reduced as the resolution increases from T126 to T254. In contrast, the bias difference between T254 and T510 is not signi cant. The dependence of the skill score on the resolution is also consistent for the RMSE. When the SOP is updated, the excessive wind speed from the CTL experiment signi cantly decreases for all resolutions, although the bias slightly increases negatively for some periods for the T510 resolution. Similarly, the RMSE scores are improved for all SOP experiments compared with those of the CTL. However, the RMSE improvement for T510 is not larger than for the other resolutions, consistent with the negatively increased bias due to the excessive wind reduction for T510. Although the parameterized orographic drag decreases as the horizontal resolution increases (by approximately 5% from T126 to T510), the excessive reduction of winds at T510 can be caused by the nonlinear interactions of the orographic drag with other processes. The effects of the updated SOP over the whole troposphere at T254 and T126 are consistent with those at T510, shown in Figure 1. CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,451 To statistically verify the updated SOP, the ensemble forecast skills for the wind speed and temperature are computed against the radiosonde data. The skill scores for the 10 day forecasts are averaged for February 2014. Figures 6a and 6c show the biases and RMSEs of the wind speed from the CTL simulation averaged over East Asia and globally. The bias patterns for the East Asian and global averages are similar to those of the short-range forecasts, mostly with an excessive (lower) wind speed for the low (middle upper) troposphere. The bias and RMSE increase with increasing forecast time, especially for the middle upper troposphere. Note that the low wind biases in the middle-upper troposphere do not imply the excessive orographic drag in the CTL experiment because its magnitude is small in the regions. Figures 6b and 6d show the differences in the bias and RMSE between the SOP and CTL experiments, with general improvement in the scores for the East Asian and global averages for the SOP experiment. For the early forecasts (~4 days), the wind improvements in the SOP experiment are noticeable in the low troposphere due to the directly enhanced orographic drag, which are consistent with those for the short-range forecasts. Although the skills are degraded in the middle-upper troposphere for the early forecasts, the improvements for the middle upper troposphere become larger with increasing forecast time in spite of the small changes in orographic drag, perhaps because of forcing terms from other physical and dynamical processes being indirectly changed by the modi ed orographic drag, as shown by Zadra et al. [2003]. The wind improvement due to the updated SOP also improves the temperature prediction via the thermal wind relationship. Figures 7a and 7c show the East Asian and global forecast skill scores for the temperature bias and RMSE from the CTL experiment for the 10 day forecast averaged for February 2014. A cold bias is noticeable both globally and for East Asia, which is reduced by the updated SOP for the low and upper troposphere. Although for the middle-troposphere this bias is intensi ed in the SOP experiment, the RMSE is improved. The statistically signi cant improvements in forecast skills for the wind and temperature are observed over the whole boreal winter period (i.e., December to February). CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,452 In addition, it is found that the statistical skill for the precipitation during February 2014 is mostly improved in the SOP experiment due to the improvements in the synoptic elds. Figure 8 shows the equivalent threat scores (ETS) for 1 to 5 day forecasts from the CTL and SOP experiments averaged over February 2014. The skill scores are calculated against rain gauge observations over South Korea. In the SOP experiment, the ETS is mostly increased (i.e., improved) compared with that in the CTL experiment, which can be due to the changes in the surface ux or/and the amount of orographic lifting indirectly caused by updating the SOP, as discussed in the short-range forecasts. Figure 9 shows the zonal mean zonal wind and temperature from the seasonal simulations for the CTL and SOP experiments, which are calculated by averages of ve-member ensembles for the boreal winter (DJF) from 2013 to 2014. The seasonal mean states during the selected period are shown to be similar to climatology under the normal SSTs. The biases of the wind and temperature shown by shading for the CTL experiment in Figures 9a and 9c are computed against the FNL data. The differences of the wind and temperature between the two experiments, which are statistically signi cant at the 95% con dence level, are shown by shading in Figures 9b and 9d. In both experiments, the structures of zonal mean zonal wind and temperature generally agree well with those in the FNL reanalysis data, although the stratospheric easterly and westerly jets (subtropical tropospheric jets) in both hemispheres are slightly weaker (stronger) compared with those of the reanalysis data, and the corresponding temperature biases are shown. A distinct difference between the two experiments appears in the winter stratospheric polar region with the reduced easterly biases (i.e., stronger polar night jet) in the SOP experiment, which correspond to the reduced warm biases in that region via the thermal wind relationship. The strengthened polar night jet in the SOP experiment is mainly due to the GWD in the winter stratosphere being reduced by considering the CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,453 orographic anisotropic effects. The skill scores (RMSE and pattern correlations) are improved for the zonal mean zonal wind and temperature by updating the SOP. Additionally, the 500 hPa height eddies (i.e., stationary eddies), which are used to validate the general ability of models, are compared between the two experiments, and overall improvements are observed in the SOP experiment. The pattern correlations with the FNL data of the simulated eddies are 0.70 and 0.77 for the CTL and SOP experiments, respectively. There is little difference in the precipitation between the two experiments (not shown). In this study, we have updated the SOP by including the effects of the orographic anisotropy and FBD and examined its impact on shortand medium-range forecasts and seasonal simulations from the GRIMs-GMP. To include the effects of orographic anisotropy, is introduced an orographic statistic, OD, according to Kim and Doyle [2005], and the formulations for the OGWD parameterization are modi ed with the OD. The FBD parameterization generally follows the study of Kim and Doyle [2005], except for the height of CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,454 the blocked layer ( h ) and the bulk drag coef cient ( C ). The h is determined by comparing the potential and kinetic energies according to the dividing streamline theory, with the blocked layer occurring when the potential energy exceeds the kinetic energy. The C is calculated as a function of the OD by including the orographic anisotropy, as in Lott and Miller [1997]. To investigate the impact of the updated SOP on the shortand medium-range forecasts and seasonal simulations, two experiments are performed using the model with original (CTL experiment) and updated (SOP experiment) SOPs. Because the effects of SOP are signi cant mainly in winter, we focus on high-impact weather events over South Korea during the boreal winter. For the short-range forecasts, a heavy snowfall event over Korea on 4 January 2010, is selected, and the impacts of the updated SOP on the synoptic elds and precipitation over East Asia are investigated by comparing the SOP and CTL results. For the mediumrange forecasts, 28-member ensembles of 10 day forecasts are performed every 00:00 UTC for February 2014, when an anomalously long-lasting heavy snowfall event over South Korea occurred, and the synoptic features and precipitation of the CTL and SOP experiments are statistically evaluated based on the forecast skills computed against the radiosonde data and rain gauge observations, respectively. The seasonal simulations consisting of ve-member ensembles are performed for DJF 2013 2014 when the seasonal mean states CHOI AND HONG SUBGRID OROGRAPHIC PARAMETERIZATION 12,455 for boreal winter are shown to be similar to climatology under the normal sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and the impacts of the updated SOP on the seasonal predictability of zonal mean zonal wind and temperature, stationary eddy, and precipitation are examined. When the SOP is updated, the CTL and SOP experiments comparison reveals that 1. The orographic drag noticeably increases because of the additional ow-blocking drag in the low troposphere. 2. The enhanced orographic drag directly weakens the wind in the low troposphere and indirectly improves the temperature and mass elds. 3. The snowfall overestimation over Korea is improved by the reduced heat uxes from the surface due to the decreased turbulent exchange coef cients, which result from the weakened wind near the surface. 4. The short-range forecast improvements are robust regardless of the model s horizontal resolution. 5. The skills of the wind speed and temperature for the medium-range forecasts are improved in the low troposphere globally and for East Asia while both positive and negative effects appear indirectly in the middle-upper troposphere. 6. The statistical skill for the precipitation is mostly improved due to the improvements in the synoptic elds. 7. The improvements in the seasonal simulations are found throughout the troposphere and stratosphere during boreal winter. As mentioned in 1, the changes in the orographic drag are mainly caused by the additional parameterization of the FBD near the surface, while the changes in the GWD, mostly associated with the orographic anisotropy, are not as signi cant in the troposphere. Nevertheless, the forecast improvements are noticed for the whole troposphere, possibly due to the interactions of the modi ed orographic drag with forcing terms from other physical and dynamical processes [e.g., Kim , 2007]. However, the GWD in the winter stratosphere from the seasonal simulations is signi cantly reduced by considering the orographic anisotropy; thus, the weak polar night jet shown in the CTL experiment is strengthened (improved) by the reduced GWD in the SOP experiment. The update of the height of the block layer ( h ) in the FBD parameterization produces more drag and leads to better forecasts in the low troposphere than when the original h is used. It is found that the forecasts for the East Asia are less sensitive to the update of the bulk drag coef cient ( C ). The future work will involve a more detailed investigation of not only the seasonal, short-range, and mediumrange forecasts but also climate simulations for the whole atmosphere considering the interactions with other wave forcing terms (i.e., nonorographic GWD, planetary wave forcing). test_jgra.pickle ---------- ['Preface to special section on East Asian Studies of Tropospheric Aerosols: An International Regional Experiment (EAST-AIRE)'] Zhanqing Li, H. Chen, M. Cribb, R. Dickerson, B. Holben, C. Li, D. Lu, Y. Luo, H. Maring, G. Shi, S.-C. Tsay, P. Wang, Y. Wang, X. Xia, Y. Zheng, T. Yuan, and F. Zhao [ ] Papers published in this special section report findings from the East Asian Study of Tropospheric Aerosols: An International Regional Experiment (EAST-AIRE). They are concerned with (1) the temporal and spatial distributions of aerosol loading and precursor gases, (2) aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA), (3) aerosol direct radiative effects, (4) validation of satellite products, (5) transport mechanisms, and (6) the effects of air pollution on ecosystems. Aerosol loading is heaviest in mideastern China with a mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) of 0.5 and increasing to 0.7 around major cities that reduced daily mean surface solar radiation by 30–40 W m , but barely changed solar reflection at the top of the atmosphere. Aerosol loading, particle size and composition vary considerably with location and season. The MODIS AOD data from Collection 5 (C5) agree much better with ground data than earlier releases, but considerable discrepancies still exist because of treatments of aerosol SSA and surface albedo. Four methods are proposed/adopted to derive the SSA by means of remote sensing and in situ observation, which varies drastically with time and space. The nationwide means of AOD, A˚ ngstro¨m exponent, and SSA (0.5 m) in China are 0.69 ± 0.17, 1.06 ± 0.26, and 0.89 ± 0.04, respectively. Measurements of trace gases reveal substantial uncertainties in emission inventories. An analysis of aircraft measurements revealed that dry convection is an important mechanism uplifting pollutants over northern China. Model simulations of nitrogen deposition and impact of ozone pollution on net primary productivity indicate an increasing threat of air pollution on the ecosystem. [ ] A key to understanding the direct and indirect radiative forcing of aerosols, which are the largest uncertainties in climate research [ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , 2007], is quantitatively characterizing aerosol properties on a region-by-region basis because both aerosol loading and properties exhibit drastic spatial and temporal variations. East Asia is a region where high aerosol concentrations are common, as is clearly shown by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product [ Kaufman et al. , 2002; Z. Li et al. , 2007a], as well as from ground-based observations [ Nakajima et al. , 2003]. According to worldwide systematic measurements of AOD from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) [ Holben et al. , 1998], the annual mean AOD in east Asia and Asia as whole is about 0.36, ranking second highest in the world next to Africa (Table 1). Coexistence of dust, industrial pollutants, and smoke over this vast area complicates satellite retrievals [ Li , 2004]. At present, there are few ground stations measuring aerosol loading and properties in most of the world’s aerosol-laden regions, including Asia. [ ] Increasing evidence suggests that the influence of aerosols on the energy and water cycles of the Earth’s system is significant [ Ramanathan et al. , 2001]. Atmospheric circulation may be altered which influences monsoons [ Lau et al. , 2006; Lau and Kim , 2006] and severe storms [ Zhang et al. , 2007]. Despite the rapid increase in the number of studies dealing with aerosol issues in recent years, it remains a daunting task to determine the extent of the influence exerted by aerosols, especially those produced by human activities, on weather, climate and ecosystem. Unraveling this question is urgent in this heavily populated and rapidly developing region of the world, where more than half of the world’s population resides. Changes in weather patterns and climate would affect the well being of billions of people. [ ] Over the past few decades, the climate in China has changed at an unprecedented rate. Perhaps the change most noticeable to the general public is a 35% reduction in visibility from the 1960s to the 1980s. During this period, the amount of direct solar radiation reaching the ground decreased by about 8.6% in China [ Luo et al. , 2000; Liang and Xia , 2005], while total solar radiation decreased by about 4.6% per decade [ Shi et al. , 2007]. The decrease in solar radiation reaching the ground is at odds with a general decreasing trend in annual mean cloud cover (1 – 3%/decade) and rainy days (1 – 4%/decade) observed at most ground stations in central, eastern, and northeastern China [ Kaiser , 1998; Liang and Xia , 2005], which is consistent with an analysis using the more reliably observed frequencies of cloud-free sky and overcast sky [ Qian et al. , 2006]. Using direct radiation measurements made at the surface, Luo et al. [2001] inferred a general increase in AOD of about 25% from 1960s to 1980s. This increase in AOD is likely the major cause for the cooling trend in central eastern China, while the rest of the country experiences significant warming [ Xu et al. , 2006]. Changes in patterns of precipitation are also considerable with a general tendency of ‘‘south wetting and north drying.’’ On the basis of model sensitivity tests, Menon et al. [2002] hypothesized the observed change in the precipitation pattern were caused by the aerosol direct effect. However, they had to assume an aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) of 0.85. This assumed value is lower than the majority of those estimated from ground and satellite measurements across China [ Lee et al. , 2007]. [ ] The aerosol direct effect may contribute to the weakening of the Asian monsoon system. Analyzing wind data in China, Xu et al. [2006] found that the surface wind speed associated with the east Asian monsoon has significantly weakened in both winter and summer seasons during the past three decades. From 1969 to 2000, annual mean wind speeds over China have decreased steadily by 28%, and the prevalence of windy days (daily mean wind speed >5 m/s) has decreased by 58%. They also found that the monsoon wind speed to be highly correlated with incoming solar radiation at the surface, which is very sensitive to aerosol loading. [ ] These changes in monsoonal winds are not surprising because the monsoon circulation is mainly driven by differential heating between the land and ocean. The dimming effect of aerosols [ Wild et al. , 2005] reduces the inhomogeneous heating between land and ocean, and thus diminishes the temperature difference, which helps weaken the monsoon [ Lau et al. , 2007]. The weakening of the east Asian monsoon system tends to decrease water vapor transport from the south to the north, prolonging the rain belt in the south, and reinforcing the trend of ‘‘south wetting and north drying.’’ [ ] Fewer investigate aerosol semi-indirect and indirect effects on cloud and precipitation because of the dearth of in situ measurements of coincident aerosol and cloud properties in this part of the world. Analyzing long-term trends of precipitation and sounding data along with short-term trends of MODIS AOD, Zhao et al. [2006] argued that the reduction in rainfall is caused by increasing atmospheric stability due to aerosol-induced heating of the atmospheric boundary layer, and proposed a positive feedback: more aerosols less precipitation more aerosols. The aerosol indirect effect was examined using MODIS aerosol and cloud products in China and other parts of the world [ Li and Yuan , 2006; Yuan et al. , 2007]. They found that aerosols tend to reduce cloud particle size in northern China but increase cloud particle size in southern China. This finding agrees with Storelvmo et al. [2006] who investigated the aerosol indirect effect using the Global Climate Model CAM-Oslo. Rosenfeld et al. [2007] reported a correlation between rainfall reduction and air pollution over a hilly region in western China, and thus proposed that pollutant aerosols decreased cloud droplet size and reduced precipitation in that region. [ ] Fully accounting for aerosol effects on climate requires extensive measurements of aerosol optical, physical (size), and chemical (composition and hygroscopic) properties. A handful of international aerosol experiments have already taken place in the east Asian region surrounding China, such as the Asian-Pacific Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-Asia) [ Huebert et al. , 2003], the NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment Transport and Chemical Evolution Over the Pacific (TRACE-P) [ Christopher , 2003], the Asian Atmospheric Particle Environment (APEX) [ Nakajima et al. , 2003], and the Atmospheric Brown Clouds-East Asian Regional Experiment (EAREX) (T. Nakajima et al., Overview of the ABC EAREX 2005 regional experiment and a study of the aerosol direct radiative forcing in east Asia, submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research , 2007, hereinafter referred to as Nakajima et al., submitted manuscript, 2007). Very few experiments have taken place inside or near mainland China. In order to gain a basic knowledge of the characteristics of aerosols and gases and an understanding of their climatic effects, the East Asian Studies of Tropospheric Aerosols: an International Regional Experiment (EASTAIRE) was established as a US-China joint research endeavor with the following primary goals: (1) to acquire and understand the physical, chemical and optical properties of dominant natural and anthropogenic aerosols and their precursor gases in China and (2) to gain insights into the direct and indirect effects of these aerosols on radiation, cloud, precipitation, atmospheric circulation and the environment. Overview of observational activities conducted under the auspices of the EAST-AIRE, including a nationwide aerosol observation network (CSHNET), observatories with extensive instrumentation, and intensive observation campaigns (IOC). [ ] In the first phase of the study, focus has been placed on obtaining in situ and remote sensing measurements of aerosols and pollutant gases near or down wind of major source regions throughout inland China. Both routine and intensive observation campaigns (IOC) have been conducted utilizing ground-based and airborne measurements. The majority of the studies presented in this special section (13 articles) made extensive use of measurements made from three types of observation programs: 2 baseline stations measuring aerosol, cloud and radiation quantities in heavy anthropogenic aerosol emission regions in northern and southern China; 25 stations measuring AOD at multiple wavelengths; and ground-based and airborne IOCs measuring the physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles and precursor gases, as well as cloud and radiation quantities. Major observation activities are highlighted in Figure 1. For more details of the project and viewing the data, visit the EAST-AIRE homepage: http://www.atmos.umd.edu/ zli/ EAST-AIRE/station.htm. Tables 2 and 3 list some of the instruments deployed for routine observations and the IOCs. [ ] Two baseline observatories were established: Xianghe (70 km southeast of Beijing) in September 2004 and Taihu Lake (100 km west of Shanghai) in September 2005. At these stations, extensive measurements are made and include (1) radiative quantities (direct, diffuse and total shortwave (SW) fluxes, longwave (LW) fluxes, ultraviolet (UV), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), ultraviolet (UV) radiation and spectral irradiances) using broadband and narrowband radiometers, and spectrometers; (2) cloud properties (cloud fraction and height, optical depth); (3) aerosol optical quantities retrieved from Cimel Sun photometers and multifilter rotating shadowband radiometers (MFRSR); and (4) physical and chemical properties from aerosol impactor samples. The quality of the data is monitored daily both locally and remotely. Redundant measurements made with independent instruments help discover data anomalies and fixing them promptly [ Xia et al. , 2007b]. The data are uploaded automatically on a daily basis via the Internet for prompt quality inspection at the University of Maryland and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics in Beijing. The Xianghe site became the first Chinese site accepted into the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and the data are archived at the BSRN data center in Switzerland. Since its commencement, qualitycontrolled data have been collected continuously without interruption. Data plots are automatically generated and can be viewed online at the EAST-AIRE homepage. In addition to these two sites there is a partially finished site at Namco in Tibet. [ ] A nationwide aerosol observation network, the Chinese Sun Hazemeter Network (CSHNET), was established in August 2004, providing daily continuous measurements of aerosol optical depths at 3 wavelengths (405 nm, 500 nm, 650 nm) at over 25 stations across China. In addition to initial in-house calibrations conducted in the United States, the handheld Sun photometers were further calibrated against the Cimel Sun photometers at Xianghe and Tibet intercomparisons and the by means of both instrument Langley method [ Xin et al. 2007]. The Cimel Sun photometer at Xianghe is calibrated annually. This is a pioneering effort at making direct aerosol measurements across China using a well-documented and quality-controlled procedure. [ ] Two consecutive IOCs were conducted in the spring of 2005: during March on the ground in Xianghe and during April from both aircraft and ground in the Liaoning province, 650 km northeast of Beijing. These IOCs took place in conjunction with the EAREX that was conducted simultaneously in the downstream region of Gosan Island off the coast of Korea (Nakajima et al., submitted manuscript, 2007). In addition to routine measurements acquired at the EAST-AIRE baseline station, observations were supplemented with IOC measurements of clouds using microwave radiometers, a micropulse lidar, and various aerosol and gas analyzers (see Tables 2 and 3). [ ] For aerosols and gases, the following extensive parameters were measured: (1) aerosol optical depth, scattering and absorbing coefficients, vertical attenuation profiles, and absorption (using a Cimel Sun photometer, nephelometer, aethalometers, PSAP); (2) aerosol physical quantities (size distribution, mass and condensation number) using aerosol filter samplers, cascade impactors, particle sizers; (3) aerosol composition using the OC/EC analyzer, aerosol filters and sample analyzers; and (4) precursor gases (ozone, NO, NO , NO , CO, SO ) using gas analyzers. [ ] Eight research flights were made under various weather conditions. Some ideal conditions were encountered, enabling the measurements of major emission sources and the mechanisms responsible for the lofting and transport of gases and particles [ Dickerson et al. , 2007], thus enabling the study of their impact on regional climate. [ ] This special section presents studies reporting major scientific findings concerning the following specific scientific questions: (1) What are the spatial and temporal distributions of general aerosols, carbonaceous aerosols and precursor gases over inland China? (2) What is the SSA of aerosols over China? (3) What is the magnitude of aerosol direct radiative forcing over China? (4) How can direct observations from EAST-AIRE help validate and improve satellite retrievals? (5) How do aerosols and precursor gases transport out of the source regions over continental China? (6) What are the effects of increasing atmospheric pollutants on the ecosystems of China, and what are the effects of urbanization on weather and climate? [ ] Prior to the EAST-AIRE, some observational efforts were made to measure aerosols and precursor gases in China, including a nationwide environmental monitoring network distributed over 300 cities [ Hao and Wang , 2005]. Many of these studies focused on in situ aerosol mass concentrations and chemical composition, shedding light on the heavy aerosol loadings and complex aerosol sources near the surface [e.g., Chan et al. , 2005; Sun et al. , 2005; Yao et al. , 2002]. Studies lasting 1 year (a) or longer disclosed seasonal changes in aerosol concentrations and origins, emphasizing the importance of dust aerosols during spring, secondary aerosols during summer, carbonaceous aerosols during biomass burning seasons, and contributions from combustion for heating during winter [e.g., Yang et al. , 2005; Zheng et al. , 2005]. Short-term experiments measured aerosol optical properties, providing critical information such as aerosol size distributions, SSA, and the hygroscopic growth factor [ Bergin et al. , 2001; Xu et al. , 2002, 2004; Xia et al. , 2005]. Other studies monitored traces gases, uncovering the processes related to pollutant emissions and photochemical smog formation [e.g., Wang et al. , 2002, 2004]. In addition, sporadic aircraft and lidar measurements, characterized three-dimensional distributions of aerosols and trace gases [e.g., Hatakeyama et al. , 2005; Zhang et al. , 2006]. These studies provide invaluable information regarding aerosol properties over east Asia, mostly on a case-by-case basis, with limited spatial and temporal coverage. Satellite observations [e.g., Li et al. , 2003] have better coverage than in situ measurements, but are subject to errors due to inaccurate assumptions concerning surface reflectance and aerosol models [ Levy et al. , 2007a, 2007b]. Studies analyzing surface solar radiation measurements provide a gross account of the long-term trends and spatial distributions of AOD over China [ Luo et al. , 2001; Qiu , 1998; Shi et al. , 2007], but calibration of instruments has always been an issue [ Li , 2004]. [ ] Xin et al. [2007] analyzed 1 a worth of AOD data from the CSHNET and found a wide range of aerosol loadings over different regions in China, with AOD at 500 nm ranging from 0.15– 0.2 over remote locations like Tibet to more than 0.5 in urban and suburban areas. Overall, annually averaged AODs over the eastern part of China are 0.5 and show little difference between urban and rural agricultural stations, suggesting the existence of a widespread haze layer over this more developed and populated area. Handheld Sun photometers with multiple channels provide additional information about particle size and aerosol types, which vary greatly with space and time, implying complex aerosol compositions and sources. AERONET observations at the two EAST-AIRE supersites [ Z. Li et al. , 2007b; Xia et al. , 2007a, 2007b] near urban centers in northern and southern China also found high aerosol loadings of mixed origins, with the mean AOD exceeding 0.6 and A˚ ngstro¨m exponents fluctuating from zero to almost 2. [ ] By providing year-round measurements of AOD, the aerosol observation network established under the EASTAIRE also enables the investigation of the temporal change in aerosol loadings and properties over China with unprecedented coverage. While seasonal variations in aerosol loadings and compositions due to changes in land surface, weather conditions (humidity and temperature), and human activities were noticed, the observed seasonal changes were dwarfed by dramatic day-to-day oscillations found at all stations over the eastern part of China [ Xia et al. , 2006; Z. Li et al. , 2007b; Mi et al. , 2007; Xia et al. , 2007a]. Fast transitions between heavily polluted episodes (AOD up to 4) and relatively clean conditions (AOD 0.2) occurred in a matter of a few days in northern China. Such changes in aerosol levels on a synoptic timescale were also observed through ground [ Chaudhry et al. , 2007; Dickerson et al. , 2007; C. Li et al. , 2007] and aircraft in situ measurements of aerosols and trace gases during the spring 2005 IOCs. Changes in weather conditions accompanying the passages of midlatitude cyclones influenced pollutant dispersion, and were responsible for the observed synoptic variations in aerosols [ C. Li et al. , 2007]. Diurnal changes in aerosol optical properties, associated with the evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and local emission sources were also well documented during the IOCs [ Chaudhry et al. , 2007; C. Li et al. , 2007]. [ ] In addition to aerosol optical measurements, Cao et al. [2007] analyzed the organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) components from daily PM samples collected at 14 cities across China. Both OC and EC concentrations reach a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer for all cities with the mean concentration ranging from 13.8 to 38.1 g m for OC and from 3.6 to 9.9 g m for EC. OC is better correlated with EC more closely in winter than summer. Carbonaceous matter accounts for about 44.2% and 38.8% of the total PM in winter and summer, respectively. Primary and secondary OC and EC account for 47.5%, 31.7% and 20.8%, respectively, of total carbon emitted in Chinese cities, with over two thirds emitted as particles. [ ] Aircraft [ Dickerson et al. , 2007] and lidar measurements [ Chaudhry et al. , 2007] also added to the very limited database of aerosol and trace gas vertical distributions over inland China. They found aerosol layers at different altitudes with distinct size distributions may exist at different levels, e.g., anthropogenic particles in the PBL and dust transported at higher altitudes. The vertical profile measurements contributed to the investigation of pollution transport mechanisms as described below. [ ] As a measure of the capability of aerosols to absorb photons, the SSA is a critical parameter defining the signs (warming or cooling) of the net climate effects of aerosol radiative forcing. Prior to the EAST-AIRE, short-term in situ measurements and ground remote sensing were conducted to determine SSA at a handful of locations over China, including different urban and suburban areas in the eastern part of China (Guangzhou in the south [ Andreae et al. , 2005], the Yangtze Delta Region (YDR) [ Xu et al. , 2002], and Beijing in the north [ Xia et al. , 2006; Bergin et al. , 2001]), as well as a desert source region in northwestern China [ Xia et al. , 2005; Xu et al. , 2004]. Overall, the SSA in the visible band over China was found to be low, with values in Beijing (0.81 from in situ measurements and 0.90 from ground remote sensing) and Guangzhou (0.85) lower than those determined in the YDR (0.93) and near deserts (0.92). Using broadband surface solar irradiance measurements, Qiu [2000] also retrieved rather low SSAs for aerosols over six cities in northern China. There still exist large inconsistencies in the reported values of SSA. [ ] Much effort has been made in the EAST-AIRE to determine SSA over China. Four different approaches have been used to determine the SSA from (1) sky radiances as estimated from Cimel Sun photometers [ Dubovik and King , 2000]; (2) a combination of spectral direct transmittance and total solar fluxes [ Zhao and Li , 2007]; (3) a combination of ground-based spectral direct transmittance and spaceborne spectral reflectance [ Lee et al. , 2007]; and (4) optical analyses of in situ aerosol samples in labs [ Chaudhry et al. , 2007]. [ ] Following the method of Dubovik and King [2000], the three AERONET sites under the aegis of the EASTAIRE provided SSA retrievals for the whole atmospheric column over long periods of time. The average AERONETretrieved SSA is about 0.9 in the visible wavelength range at all stations, confirming the presence of aerosols with strong absorbing properties, which was suggested by previous studies [ Eck et al. , 2005; Xia et al. , 2006], but not as low as was found in other studies [e.g., Qiu , 2000]. The AERONET approach requires scanning the sky with a robotic Sun photometer. SSA was also retrieved from downwelling surface shortwave fluxes together with spectral direct radiances [ Zhao and Li , 2007]. Their 1-a SSA retrievals using data from Xianghe have accuracies and uncertainties comparable to colocated AERONET retrievals (0.891 versus 0.886). This algorithm can be applied to CSHNET stations instrumented with both handheld Sun photometers and pyranometers, thus enhancing the potential of obtaining SSA information over a large area at a relatively low cost. Unfortunately, few CSHNET stations were equipped with pyranometers; the deployment of this instrument at more sites is planned for the future. Another approach used to estimate the SSA utilizes coincident measurements of direct transmittance made with handheld Sun photometers on the ground and reflected radiance at the top of the atmosphere from the spaceborne MODIS [ Lee et al. , 2007]. This approach is particularly suitable for China as aerosol loading is generally high so the sensitivity to surface albedo is reduced enough to obtain SSA with reasonable accuracies. By applying the method to all CSHNET station data, SSA was derived across China for all months, leading to a gross knowledge about the spatial and temporal variations of SSA for the first time [ Lee et al. , 2007]. The nationwide average SSA is 0.89. Relatively low SSA is found in northeastern China, central-north China and western China during winter seasons. In the heart of a major industrial zone in eastern China, SSA is somewhat higher information on aerosol (0.90 – 0.92). This fundamental property is critical for determining aerosol radiative forcing at the top and bottom of the atmosphere across the region. [ ] During the ground-based IOC carried out in Xianghe in 2005, in situ measurements of SSA were also made from a combination of aerosol scattering and aerosol absorption measurements [ C. Li et al. , 2007]. SSA values at 500 nm derived from these in situ measurements were typically 0.8– 0.85, but ranged as low as 0.7 at times. These values are similar to the in situ measurements made by Bergin et al. [2001] in Beijing but significantly lower than the colocated AERONET retrievals, presumably reflecting the sampling difference between in situ instruments (near ground) and Cimel Sun photometers (whole atmospheric column), although measurement uncertainties play a role. If aerosols at ground level are indeed much more absorbing than those at higher altitudes, as suggested by these studies, the resulting vertically differential aerosol radiative heating may influence atmospheric stability, weather patterns, and the evolution of the PBL [ Yu et al. , 2002]. [ ] Changes in the SSA with height are also thought to be the major cause for the discrepancies between SSA measured from daily aerosol samples and inferred from the AERONET at the Xianghe site where Nuclepore filters were collected for the first 5 months of 2005 [ Chaudhry et al. , 2007]. From these samples, both mass concentration in various bins and SSA in different spectral bands were measured in the NASA/GSFC lab and compared with those retrieved from AERONET Sun photometers. The groundbased measurements compare favorably with AERONET retrievals in cases of vertical homogeneity in aerosol concentrations observed by lidars. When there existed multiple layers of aerosols, the two sets of measurements deviate and their disparity tends to increase with increase in aerosol loading. In general, ground-based measurements produces lower values of SSA than AERONET retrievals; consistent with the finding of C. Li et al. [2007] based on collocated PSAP and nephelometer measurements. [ ] the surface and at In previous studies, shipboard [ Markowicz et al. , 2003] and ground-based radiometers [ Kim et al. , 2005], aerosol transport-radiation models [ Takemura et al. , 2003], in situ measured aerosol data and radiative transfer models [ Conant et al. , 2003], and satellite radiance measurements [ Nakajima et al. , 2003] were used to estimate the aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) over the western Pacific and east Asia, an area under frequent influence of plumes from upwind aerosol source regions. At the surface, these studies generally found strong direct negative radiative forcing of more than 10 W/m due to aerosol scattering and absorption. Relatively less has been done to quantify the aerosol radiative forcing over the inland areas of China. Many existing studies focusing on aerosol radiative forcing in China are based on model simulations rather than actual observations [e.g., Giorgi et al. , 2002; Qian et al. , 2003]. [ ] A key step in differentiating the radiative effects of aerosols and clouds is to identify cloudy, hazy, and clean scenes. This poses a serious challenge over China because very high aerosol loadings can be difficult to distinguish from cloudy conditions. In this special section, Z. Li et al. [2007b] and Xia et al. [2007a] demonstrate the successful application of a number of cloud screening techniques combining direct/diffuse shortwave radiation measurements, lidar temporal derivatives of shortwave fluxes, measurements, and sky images. Aerosol reduction of surface shortwave irradiance was estimated at about 30 W/m at the Liaozhong site in northeastern China, during the observation period from April to June 2005 [ Xia et al. , 2007a]. At the Xianghe site near Beijing, the annual and daily (24 hours) mean aerosol radiative effect at the surface (24 W/m ) was only moderately lower than the cloud radiative effect (41 W/m ) [ Z. Li et al. , 2007a; Xia et al. , 2007b]. At the TOA, the aerosol radiative effect was only one tenth of that at the surface, suggesting strong heating of the atmosphere by aerosols [ Z. Li et al. , 2007b]. At the Taihu site in southeastern China, the annual mean aerosol radiative effect amounts to 38.4 W m . Heavy aerosol loading in this region leads to reductions of 112.6 W m and 45.5 W m in direct and global solar radiation, respectively, and an increase of 67.1 W m in diffuse radiation reaching the surface [ Xia et al. , 2007c]. [ ] The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), a well-calibrated multiwavelength satellite sensor, has been providing high-quality global aerosol products since 2000. Over land, MODIS retrievals are subject to errors originating primarily from inaccurate assumptions concerning surface reflectance and aerosol models. AERONET-observed AOD products have been extensively used to validate MODIS aerosol products around the world [e.g., Chu et al. , 2002; Levy et al. , 2005; Ichoku et al. , 2002; Remer et al. , 2005]. Prior to the EAST-AIRE, few comparisons were done over China [e.g., Xia et al. , 2004]. [ ] Taking advantage of data from the two Chinese AERONET sites established under the aegis of the EASTAIRE, Mi et al. [2007] made a detailed examination of MODIS Collection 4 (C004) and Collection 5 (C005) aerosol products over China. It was found that over northern China, errors in land surface reflectance resulted in substantial errors in C004 AOD. Over southern China where the land surface more closely matches the assumptions in the C04 retrievals, errors due to the preassumed SSA of 0.85 compared to 0.9 (retrieved from AERONET) dominated. With the incorporation of significantly improved land surface models and aerosol models into the retrieval algorithm [ Levy et al. , 2007a, 2007b], the C005 MODIS aerosol products over China compare much better with AERONET observations. [ ] Compared to AERONET measurements, aerosol observations made by the CSHNET handheld Sun photometers provide less spectral information but offer much larger spatial coverage. The CSHNET data allow for validation of MODIS aerosol products over a range of distinct types of land surfaces. Similar to Mi et al. [2007], Z. Li et al. [2007a] found that the performance of MODIS C005 aerosol products were in much better agreement with ground aerosol measurements than MODIS C004 products. However, the performance of the MODIS C005 product varied greatly with surface and aerosol types, with overestimation of AOD over bright surfaces (deserts, semideserts, and urban areas) and underestimation of AOD over dark surfaces (forest). Smaller discrepancies were generally found when the MODIS-assumed surface reflectance was similar to the surface reflectance corrected under clean and clear sky conditions. Such comparisons provide further insight into the possible error sources of satellite retrievals and can thus help improve aerosol products in the future. [ ] SO retrievals from the Ozone Mapping Instrument (OMI) onboard the Earth Observing System (EOS)/Aura satellite have also benefited from the EAST-AIRE data set. SO profiles obtained during the EAST-AIRE aircraft IOC were used to correct the air mass factor (AMF) in OMI operational SO retrievals, leading to substantially better agreement between aircraft-observed and OMI-retrieved SO column amounts (N. Krotkov et al., OMI SO validation over eastern China using in situ aircraft measurements, submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research , 2007). Improved OMI SO retrievals successfully tracked a SO plume originating from the flight area of the aircraft experiment, and gave reasonable estimates of SO lifetimes [ Dickerson et al. , 2007]. [ ] With the potential of lifting pollutants out of the PBL in a relatively short time, convection [e.g., Dickerson et al. , 1987] and the warm conveyor belt (WCB, the large-scale isentropic upward motion within the warm sector of a midlatitude wave cyclone) [e.g., Bey et al. , 2001] have been proposed as major mechanisms responsible for longrange transport of aerosols and precursor gases. Both processes are well characterized over North America and the north Atlantic through extensive aircraft measurements [e.g., Bertram et al. , 2007]. To date, most of the aircraft measurements investigating pollutant plumes out of east Asia were conducted over the western Pacific, downwind of the major emission sources in China. These studies generally emphasized the role of WCB in pollutant transport from east Asia [e.g., Cooper et al. , 2004; Mari et al. , 2004] because convection is often localized and its effects are not readily discernable in downwind regions. [ ] During the April 2005 EAST-AIRE aircraft IOC, eight research flights were made under a variety of weather conditions in northeastern China centered over Shenyang, a large industrial city 650 km northeast of Beijing. Vertical profiles of trace gases and aerosol optical properties were obtained in both warm and cold sectors of midlatitude cyclones, showing distinct chemical characteristics ahead versus behind cold fronts. Substantial amounts of pollutants were found well above the PBL during the flight on 5 April [ Dickerson et al. , 2007]. Trajectory analysis and satellite observations suggest that the enhanced pollutant levels at higher altitudes were likely convectively lifted in the regions west of Shenyang and then transported by westerly winds. The WCB did not effectively vent pollutants out of the PBL over land, but intensified once the cyclone moved off the Chinese coast. In this particular case, over land, dry (nonprecipitating) convection may be more efficient in lifting pollution out of the PBL. There was large-scale lifting of pollutants associated with a cyclone on 11 April. However, in this case, the pollutants only ascended to a limited height over land (within the PBL) and had little potential for long-range transport, confirming the episodic nature of trans-Pacific transport. [ ] Such case studies shed light on the mechanisms of long-range pollutant transport out of east Asia. A better understanding the relative roles of WCB and convective processes under different situations necessitates an integral approach incorporating in situ measurements, satellite observations, and model simulations so that knowledge about which transport mechanisms are most important in particular situations. To this end, it is necessary to analyze various satellite data sets, conduct more field experiments and run more model simulations. [ ] While much attention has been paid to the health and climatic effects of aerosols and trace gases, there is accumulating evidence suggesting the effects of air pollutants on ecosystems. Through interactions with radiation, aerosols may perturb the carbon budget [e.g., Gu et al. , 2003] and reduce agricultural yields [ Chameides et al. , 1999a]. An essential nutritional element for plant growth, nitrogen deposition in the form of nitrogen-containing aerosols and gases may also alter the functioning of ecosystems [e.g., Tian et al. , 2003]. Ozone, an important gas pollutant closely related to the generation of secondary particles, may adversely affect ecosystems and decrease crop yields [ Aunan et al. , 2000; Chameides et al. , 1999b]. [ ] Using available precipitation chemistry measurements and ambient trace gas monitoring, Lu¨ and Tian [2007] estimated wet and dry deposition of nitrogen over China from 1990 to 2003. They found the mean nitrogen deposition rate over south-central China was higher than in the Unites States and Europe, probably because of rapid industrialization in that region. Large areas in China with sensitive ecosystems, such as coniferous forests, grasslands and deserts, are under the risk of nitrogen saturation or even acidification. A rise of 7 – 8% in nitrogen dry deposition was found over China, by comparing the averaged dry deposition fluxes during 1999 – 2003 and 1990 – 1994. Consequently, air pollution in China may pose threat to a range of ecosystems. Another paper [ Ren et al. , 2007] estimated the influence of ozone on net primary product and carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems in China, highlighting a possible link between air pollution and the carbon cycle. Their simulation results showed that elevated O could result in a mean 4.5% reduction in NPP and 0.9% reduction in total carbon storage nationwide from 1961 to 2000. The O effects on carbon fluxes and storage are dependent upon environmental factors. The effects of O should thus be taken into account in order to accurately assess the regional carbon budget in China. [ ] the so-called ‘‘urban heat It has long been recognized that temperatures over urbanized areas are commonly higher than over the surrounding rural areas, island’’ (UHI) effect [ Oke , 1976]. On local scales, the effects of urbanization on climate may be comparable to or even greater than those directly associated with greenhouse gas accumulation. Utilizing MODIS-retrieved land surface temperature/emissivity, vegetation indices, BRDF/Albedo, and land cover products, Wang et al. [2007] identified the prominent UHI effect of the Beijing metropolitan area, where the daytime temperature difference between the city center and suburban areas can be more than 10 C in summer, although distinctive diurnal and seasonal variations exist. Less evaporation over the urban region, different thermal parameters between urban and rural areas, and anthropogenic heat fluxes from the urban area were proposed as major factors controlling the seasonal and diurnal patterns in the UHI effect. [ ] East Asia with China at its heart is one of major aerosol source regions in the world. While aerosols of natural origin (e.g., dust) continue to be a severe problem for this area, particles of anthropogenic origin (e.g., sulfates) have significantly increased over the past few decades. Aerosol impacts are likely substantial, but these effects are not well identified or quantified because of insufficient knowledge and understanding of the interactions of aerosols with ecosystems and climate. [ ] Through a cooperative research endeavor between Chinese and American institutions, a coordinated observation program was initiated, providing continuous highquality measurements across China. It consists of twenty stations and two supersites making measurements on a routine basis over diverse climate zones and ecosystems within China. Intensive ground-based and airborne observation campaigns augmented the observational database. Some major findings during the first 3 a of the EAST-AIRE are reported in this special section. While previous observations confirm the existence of a haze layer over eastern China, the extensiveness of the EAST-AIRE network provides more detailed information about the temporal and spatial features of key aerosol properties and precursor gases. Simultaneous measurements of aerosols and irradiance has enabled the quantification of aerosol radiative effects, as well as development of few new SSA retrieval algorithms. Expanding high-quality ground-based aerosol observation networks (AERONET and CSHNET) to different regions in China enabled validation of and improvements in satellite retrievals useful for climate and ecosystem modeling. The vertical profiling capabilities of lidar and instrumented aircraft added to our knowledge of the vertical variations of aerosols and precursor gases essential for investigating aerosol effects on atmospheric stability and understanding the mechanisms of pollutant transport. Case studies with aircraft data shed some light on the potential role of dry convection on long-range transport of pollutants over east Asia. Aircraft-measured SO profiles also helped improve satellite retrievals of this important pollutant. The effects of aerosols and trace gases on ecosystems and the carbon cycle were estimated using observational data. Satellites detected prominent urban heat island effects over Beijing, which was attributed to changes in the land surface due to the process of urbanization.

J. P R B State-of-the-art comprehensive global climate models (GCMs) display a wide range of global and regional sensitivity to imposed large-scale climate forcings. The 5845 equilibrium global surface temperature increase projected to result from a doubling of atmospheric CO concentration reported for the models in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) intercomparison varies from 2.1 to 4.4 K. This range has not narrowed appreciably compared to that found in earlier model intercomparisons (e.g., Houghton et al. 2001). The variation in global climate sensitivity among these GCMs is largely attributable to differences in cloud feedbacks and feedbacks of low-level clouds in particular (e.g., Bony and Dufresne 2005; Stowasser et al. 2006; Solomon et al. 2007; Medeiros et al. 2008). Persistent stratocumulus decks found predominantly in the subtropical eastern ocean margins have a major impact on the radiation budget by reﬂecting incoming solar radiation (e.g., Randall et al. 1984; Hartmann and Doelling 1991). These clouds are prominent over cool ocean surfaces in regions where large-scale atmospheric subsidence leads to the formation of sharp temperature inversions, which trap moisture in the marine boundary layer (MBL; e.g., Albrecht et al. 1988). The simulation of these marine clouds has been a particular challenge for global and regional models (e.g., Bretherton et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2004a,b). This results in a particularly high uncertainty of the climate feedback of these low-level marine clouds (e.g., Bony and Dufresne 2005; Solomon et al. 2007). Medeiros et al. (2008) showed that trade wind cumuli might also play an important role; they are also not well captured by global climate models (Medeiros and Stevens 2009). The radiative effect of low marine clouds is dominated by their contribution to the planetary albedo as their impact on outgoing longwave radiation is limited because of the small temperature difference between cloud tops and the underlying surface. The cloud optical depth for these low-level clouds is proportional to cloud geometrical thickness, the liquid water content (LWC), and the size of the cloud droplets. There have been attempts to use empirical guidance to determine how these basic cloud properties, and hence albedo, may respond to changes in large-scale climate. The empirical relationship between cloud LWC and temperature obtained by Feigelson (1978) from aircraft measurements of midlatitude clouds for the temperature range between 25 and 5 C predicts an increase in cloud water with temperature. Somerville and Remer (1984) noted that if a constant cloud geometrical thickness for marine stratocumulus decks is assumed, a negative cloud–climate feedback would be implied (i.e., warmer temperatures would lead to more reﬂective clouds). On the other hand, studies analyzing satellite data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) indicate that cloud optical depth of low marine clouds might be expected to decrease with increasing temperature (Tselioudis et al. 1992; Greenwald et al. 1995; Chang and Coakley 2007; Eitzen et al. 2008). This suggests a positive shortwave cloud–climate feedback for marine stratocumulus decks. In a recent paper, Clement et al. (2009) analyzed several decades of ship-based observations of cloud cover along with more recent satellite observations, with a focus on the northeastern (NE) Paciﬁc between 15 and 25 N. They found that there is a negative correlation between cloud cover and sea surface temperature (SST) apparent on a long time scale—again suggesting a positive cloud– climate feedback in this region. Bony and Dufresne (2005) analyzed 17 yr of observed SST, top of atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux, and 500-hPa vertical velocity ( ) from satellite data and reanalyses, respectively. Focusing only on the ocean regions between 30 S and 30 N, they scaled the anomalies in monthly mean TOA fluxes with the coincident SST anomalies. This analysis was done for grid points in different dynamical regimes deﬁned by the 500-hPa vertical velocity. They showed that the cloud feedback parameter deﬁned this way is dominated by changes to the shortwave flux and that the feedbacks are positive and in the range of 0–6 W m K . The Bony and Dufresne estimate of this feedback is largest in the regions with the strongest 500-hPa subsidence (corresponding to the regions of low-level marine clouds). Of course, as emphasized by Bony and Dufresne, the cloud responses to natural interannual variations of SST may differ from the response expected to large-scale forced global warming. Cloud feedbacks have also been assessed by a number of modeling studies using a variety of models—ranging from single-column radiative–convective equilibrium models to GCMs with conventional cloud parameterizations (e.g., Somerville and Remer 1984; Xu et al. 2010; Roeckner et al. 1987; Caldwell and Bretherton 2009; Tselioudis et al. 1998; Zhang and Bretherton 2008) or to GCMs with superparameterizations in which a cloudresolving model (CRM) is run within each GCM column (e.g., Wyant et al. 2009). However, state-of-the-art GCMs display a wide range of simulated cloud–climate feedbacks in the marine stratocumulus regions. In addition, such models generally do a poor job in simulating the present-day climatology of marine stratocumulus clouds. The dynamics of marine stratocumulus clouds involve tightly coupled interactions among atmosphere, ocean, and land making them extremely challenging for climate models to capture (e.g., Bony and Dufresne 2005). Singlecolumn models and large-eddy simulations (LES) can explicitly represent detailed cloud microphysics, but the interaction between clouds and the large-scale atmospheric 5846 circulation in such models has to be prescribed or determined on the basis of simpliﬁed assumptions. This paper describes a modeling study of the response of clouds in the eastern tropical and subtropical Paciﬁc region to large-scale climate forcing. The eastern Paciﬁc region features extensive stratocumulus decks and the cloud feedbacks in this region in climate models contribute signiﬁcantly to the global mean feedbacks and climate sensitivity (e.g., Stowasser et al. 2006). For this investigation we used the version of the International Paciﬁc Research Center (IPRC) Regional Atmospheric Model (iRAM) described in Lauer et al. (2009). Lauer et al. (2009) also showed that iRAM is able to simulate a reasonable present-day seasonal climatology of stratocumulus clouds in the eastern Paciﬁc region. As part of the present study we will show that iRAM simulates the basic cloud climatology in the eastern Paciﬁc better than current GCMs. We will also show that iRAM successfully simulates the main features of the observed interannual variation of clouds in this region, including the evolution of the clouds through the ENSO cycle. Section 2 describes the regional climate model used in this study and the details of the present-day and global warming simulations. This is followed by a comparison of modeled cloud properties over the east Paciﬁc with observations in section 3. Section 4 presents the results of the cloud response to global warming. The conclusions are summarized in section 5. a. iRAM IPRC iRAM is based on the hydrostatic primitive equations and uses coordinates in the vertical (Wang et al. 2004a). All model simulations presented here were conducted at a horizontal resolution of 0.5 0.5 , with the model domain covering the tropical and subtropical eastern Paciﬁc as well as large parts of South America (40 S–40 N and 160 –50 W). There are 28 model levels from the surface up to about 10 hPa ( 30 km) with 10 levels below 800 hPa. We used the final analysis data (FNL) from the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction [(NCEP); NCEP FNL Operational Model Global Tropospheric Analyses, continuing from July 1999, are updated daily. Dataset ds083.2 is published by the Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) Data Support Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, Colorado, available online at http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ ds083.2/] as initial and lateral boundary conditions for the model integrations. The FNL data with a horizontal resolution of 1 1 and 26 vertical pressure levels (NCEP–NCAR reanalysis with a horizontal resolution of 2.5 2.5 and 17 pressure levels prior to the year 2000; Kalnay et al. 1996) at 6-h time intervals are interpolated linearly in time and using cubic splines to the model grid. SSTs employed are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) analyses (Reynolds et al. 2007), which are based on daily mean satellite observations from AVHRR and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) instruments. The prognostic model variables are nudged to the NCEP FNL analysis data within a 10 buffer zone along the lateral boundaries. The buffer zone is not in the analyses of the results shown here. Grid-scale cloud processes are calculated using a double-moment cloud microphysics scheme with a semiprognostic aerosol component considering six aerosol species—sulfate, sea salt, soluble and insoluble organic matter, black carbon, and mineral dust (Phillips et al. 2007, 2008, 2009)—which replaces the original singlemoment cloud microphysics module of Wang (2001). The cloud microphysics scheme predicts the mass mixing ratios of water vapor, cloud liquid water, cloud ice, rain, snow, and graupel as well as the number mixing ratios of cloud droplets and ice crystals. The size distributions of cloud and precipitation particles are assumed to follow gamma distributions. Diffusional growth of cloud particles and precipitation is predicted explicitly with a linearized supersaturation scheme from the modeled updraft and properties of cloud liquid and water vapor. The predicted supersaturation is applied to calculate the activation of aerosol particles at cloud base using the aerosol activation scheme of Ming et al. (2006) or inside the cloud when supersaturation becomes high enough. Critical droplet diameters and supersaturations as well as the equilibrium supersaturations of the droplets are obtained from the -Ko¨ hler theory using the hygroscopicity parameters from Petters and Kreidenweis (2007). The autoconversion of cloud droplets to rainwater is parameterized after Liu et al. (2007). We chose the parameterization from Liu et al. (2007) over other schemes as it results in improved agreement for our regional model with a 50-km resolution between modeled and observed liquid water path (LWP) and cloud cover. Primary and secondary ice nucleation (Hallet and Mossop 1974), as well as homogeneous freezing of aerosols (Koop et al. 2000) and cloud droplets (Phillips et al. 2007), are included. All the known and empirically quantiﬁed mechanisms for initiation of cloud droplets and ice are represented (Phillips et al. 2007). The cloud microphysics module is coupled to the radiation scheme and provides effective radii of cloud droplets and ice crystals as well as the liquid water and ice content as input for the radiative transfer calculations. 5847 The radiation scheme is based on the radiation package of Edwards and Slingo (1996) with improvements by Sun and Rikus (1999). It considers four bands in the solar spectral range and seven bands in the thermal spectral range. Cloud amount is diagnosed from cloud liquid water/ice content and relative humidity following Xu and Randall (1996). Subgrid-scale convection including shallow, mid-level, and deep convection is parameterized following Tiedtke (1989) with modiﬁcations by Gregory et al. (2000). The average entrainment rate for shallow convection and relative mass flux at a level of zero buoyancy (overshooting cumuli) have been adjusted using results from large-eddy simulations (Wang et al. 2004a,b). Cloud water and cloud ice detrained at the cloud tops are considered as an additional source of cloud water/ice used by the grid-scale cloud microphysics (Wang et al. 2003). The iRAM results with double-moment cloud microphysics have been compared extensively to measurements from aircraft, ships, and satellites to evaluate the model performance simulating clouds over the eastern Paciﬁc (Lauer et al. 2009). This evaluation showed that the model is able to simulate average cloud properties such as liquid water content, cloud droplet number concentration, cloud cover, and the radiative effect of clouds [also referred to as cloud radiative forcing (CRF)] that compare well with the observed climatology. Lauer et al. (2009) also showed that the diurnal cycle of cloud liquid water over the eastern Paciﬁc is reasonably well simulated by iRAM. For additional details on iRAM, we refer to Wang (2001), Wang et al. (2004a), and the literature cited therein. Additional details on the double-moment cloud microphysics scheme and a model evaluation can be found in Phillips et al. (2007, 2008, 2009) and Lauer et al. (2009), respectively. b. Model experiments In the present study, we performed two kinds of experiments: a simulation of January 1997–December 2008 using observed SSTs and lateral boundary conditions and a set of 10-yr integrations designed to simulate late twenty-ﬁrst-century conditions. For the twenty-ﬁrst-century experiments we apply what has been termed the ‘‘pseudo-global-warming’’ (PGW) method, which has been employed in other recent studies to downscale global climate change projections using a regional atmospheric model (Kimura and Kitoh 2007; Sato et al. 2007; Knutsen et al. 2008). In the PGW method, initial and lateral boundary conditions for the model integration are given by the sum of 6-h reanalysis data as used for the present-day experiment and a climate change signal based on results from a coupled global climate model (or an ensemble of such models). We based the climate change signals used in iRAM on the monthly averaged differences between present-day climate and projections for the end of the twenty-ﬁrst century made by GCMs included in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Speciﬁcally, the climate change signal adopted here was computed as the difference in 10-yr means for each calendar month for the late twentieth century [1990–99 in the AR4 twentieth-century forced runs (20C3M) and for the late twenty-ﬁrst century 2090–99 in the Special Report of Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B runs]. Data were obtained from the World Climate Research Programme’s (WCRP’s) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) data archive (Meehl et al. 2007). Following the A1B scenario, we increased the CO concentration in iRAM from 370 ppm used in the present-day run to 720 ppm. Here, we only consider global warming perturbations of the meteorological boundary conditions [i.e., temperature, horizontal wind components, sea level pressure (SLP), and humidity] and of the SST. Concentrations of trace gases other than CO such as ozone or aerosols were not changed in our global warming simulations and remained at their present-day levels. Of course the global change signals differ quite signiﬁcantly among the CMIP–AR4 GCMs. We performed three 10-yr experiments using 1999–2008 as the base and adding different climate change signals derived from the results of the CMIP–AR4 model simulations: 1) IPCC AR4 ensemble mean (case A): The climate change signal is averaged over all 19 AR4 models (see Table 1) that provided all data needed for specifying the climate change contribution to the boundary conditions in iRAM. All model results are interpolated to the 1 1 grid and 26 pressure levels of the FNL data before averaging. 2) Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) Coupled General Circulation Model, version 3.1(T63) (CGCM3.1; case B): The climate change signal is obtained from simulations with CGCM3.1 (McFarlane et al. 1992; Flato 2005) of CCCma. Among the AR4 GCMs, the CGCM3.1 has one of the higher global climate sensitivities and also has a strong positive cloud–climate feedback over the eastern Paciﬁc (see Fig. 9 below). 3) NCAR Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3; case C): The climate change signal is obtained from NCAR CCSM3 (Collins et al. 2006). Among the AR4 GCMs, the CCSM3 has one of the lower global climate sensitivities and also has a negative cloud–climate feedback over the eastern Paciﬁc (see Fig. 9 below). 5848 5849 The PGW method has some obvious limitations, notably the variability from daily to interannual periods in the boundary conditions is necessarily the same in the warming simulations and in the present-day simulation (e.g., Hara et al. 2008). We would also like to note that this study examines cloud response to a given climate change signal only. The usage of prescribed SSTs does not allow for possible atmosphere–ocean feedbacks. We expect that an interactive coupling of atmosphere and ocean could modify the climate change signals and may thus result in a different cloud response. In this section, we compare the cloud fields in our present-day iRAM simulation with observations. We compare 10-yr mean simulated values with observed climatology. We also evaluate the interannual variations in the simulation, which provides an opportunity to see how realistically the simulated clouds respond to changes in large-scale meteorological forcing. We also evaluate correlations between simulated low-level cloud amount and, for instance, sea surface temperatures, lowertropospheric stability (LTS), or 500-hPa vertical velocities. These correlations are then compared to corresponding correlations obtained from observations. a. Shortwave cloud forcing Shortwave cloud forcing (SCF) at the top of the atmosphere is calculated as the difference between all-sky and clear-sky shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the multiyear annual average SCF from iRAM as well as from 16 IPCC AR4 models with multiyear (2000–05) satellite observations from CERES (Loeb et al. 2009). Observations show a large area of small (absolute) SCF south of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and between the western domain boundary at 150 W and about 100 W. These weakly negative SCF values correspond to a low average cloud amount over the warm-pool region. The size and extent of this area are reproduced by iRAM reasonably well, although the maximum SCF values are overestimated by about 5 W m compared with the CERES observations. The satellite data show the most negative SCF in our domain in the ITCZ and in the two stratocumulus decks off the coasts of North and South America. Here, iRAM overestimates the 5850 magnitude of the SCF in the ITCZ by about 25%, but the modeled SCF of the stratocumulus decks agrees well with the observations. However, the stratocumulus deck in iRAM over the southeastern (SE) Paciﬁc is shifted by about 9 ( 1000 km) northwestward compared with the observed, also seen in the simulated cloud liquid water and cloud cover. Lauer et al. (2009) speculated that this deﬁciency could be related to the model horizontal resolution, which leads to an overly smooth representation of the steep Andes. Table 2 summarizes the multiyear mean cloud properties averaged over the ocean region of the model domain. Speciﬁcally cloud forcing, cloud amount, liquid water path, and rain rate from iRAM are compared with satellite observations. The details of the satellite datasets used for comparison are given in the table along with relevant references. The model overpredicts the average SCF over the ocean by 7 W m and underpredicts the magnitude of the longwave cloud forcing (LCF) by 4 W m compared with satellite measurements. This overestimation in the magnitude of SCF is mainly caused by a too large (absolute) SCF in the ITCZ as well as an underprediction of the extent of the region of weak SCF associated with the warm pool. The small values of domain-averaged LCF in the model mainly reﬂect an underestimation of cirrus clouds in, and north of, the ITCZ. The difference between domain-averaged modeled and observed total cloud forcing (CF ) is about 10 W m . Figure 1 also shows that the 16 IPCC AR4 models investigated here, with the possible exception of the Met Ofﬁce (UKMO) Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 1 (HadGEM1) model, fail to adequately reproduce the large area of small magnitude of SCF over the warm-pool region. Among the better models in reproducing observed SCF in the ITCZ and the two stratocumulus regions are the two Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) models that, however, fail to reproduce the extent and position of the stratocumulus deck in the southeastern Paciﬁc. b. Cloud amount, liquid water path, and rainfall The results in Table 2 show that the domain-averaged iRAM simulated low cloud cover (35%) is in good agreement with satellite observations (33%). Here, lowlevel cloud amount refers to clouds below 680 hPa. While low-level cloud amount can be averaged over all time steps in the model, the satellite data cover only periods not obstructed by high-level clouds. This is, however, not expected to be a problem as the satellite data show only small differences between low-level and total cloud amount in the stratocumulus regions, which are the main focus of this study. The domain-averaged total cloud cover in iRAM is 48%, rather less than the 58% from the satellite climatology, a difference that reﬂects the underprediction of the cirrus clouds in and north of the ITCZ in iRAM. The modeled multiyear annual average LWP over the ocean, 63 g m , is in good agreement with 62 g m determined from satellite observations. Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of the iRAM simulated LWP compared with observations and the 20C3M simulations in the IPCC GCMs. The iRAM captures the observed overall pattern reasonably well, whereas the IPCC models vary widely among themselves and none reproduces all the major features in the observed LWP. The domain-average rainfall rate in iRAM over the ocean is 3.4 mm day , which is considerably higher than the 2.0 mm day in the satellite-based climatology. Li and Fu (2005) showed that the rainfall climatology from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data has lower average rain rates than the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP; Huffman et al. 1997; Adler et al. 2003), particularly over the ocean. A comparison of the geographical pattern of long-term mean rain rate with satellite observations (not shown) reveals that iRAM captures the location and intensity of the rain rate over most of the ocean reasonably well, but the belt of heavy rainfall in the ITCZ is overestimated by iRAM in both its meridional extent and its intensity. 5851 c. Low-level cloud amount and lower-tropospheric stability Observations show that the low-level cloud cover in tropical and subtropical regions is strongly correlated with LTS, deﬁned as the difference in potential temperatures at 700 hPa and the surface (LTS – ) (Slingo 1980, 1987; Klein and Hartmann 1993). For the tropical and subtropical clouds over the eastern Paciﬁc in our model domain we find very similar correlations between observed low-level cloud amount and LTSestimated inversion strength (Wood and Bretherton 2006). In this study, we use LTS for our analysis. We combined monthly mean ISCCP satellite observations of low-level cloud amount (Rossow et al. 1996) with LTS values calculated from monthly mean NCEP final analysis data (NCEP–NCAR reanalysis before the year 2000; Kalnay et al. 1996). The ISCCP data (2.5 2.5 ) are interpolated to the 1 1 grid of the FNL data. For comparison with results from iRAM we averaged the model data onto the 1 1 FNL grid. The black and blue dots in Fig. 3a show low-level cloud amount binned by LTS values from the combined ISCCP–NCEP dataset and from iRAM for the years 2000–07. The mean low-level cloud amount and its standard deviation are calculated for all grid cells in the whole domain (30 S–30 N and 150 –60 W) and all individual monthly means in the time period 2000–07 within the same LTS bin. The vertical bars show 1 standard deviation. The standard deviation within each LTS bin will reﬂect spatial, annual, and interannual variability. Observations and model show an approximately linear increase in low cloud amount with increasing LTS. Such a linear relationship between seasonal mean LTS and low-level cloud amount for regions in the subtropics has also been found by Klein and Hartmann (1993). A linear fit to the observations in Fig. 3a has a slope of 0.031 K , which is close to the 0.030 K obtained for the present-day iRAM simulation. The range of variability of cloud amount for any given LTS value is larger in the model than in the observations. The difference even persists when the iRAM data are averaged to 2.5 resolution to be directly comparable to the ISCCP data. The corresponding probability density functions (PDFs) of monthly mean LTS from the present-day iRAM simulation and NCEP FNL data are shown as the blue and black curves in Fig. 3b. For both model and FNL data the most common LTS values are found to be in the range of 12–14 K. Maximum LTS densities are found 5852 to be at 12.8 K for NCEP FNL data and 13.2 K for the iRAM present-day simulation. The model reproduces the LTS PDF from NCEP FNL data for the east Paciﬁc region reasonably well, although the modeled distribution is wider than the observed one for small LTS values (LTS 10–12 K). Figure 3c shows the changes in the LTS–low-level cloud amount relationship between the strong El Nin˜ o year 1997 and the year 2005 (no El Nin˜ o or La Nin˜ a events) from iRAM and NCEP/ISCCP data. Average LTS and low-level cloud amount in the El Nin˜ o year were calculated for the same grid cells and months that 5853 were used to calculate low-level cloud amount for each of the year 2005 LTS bins. LTS decreases in the El Nin˜ o year for all bins with year 2005 LTS values larger than 14 K in the NCEP data and larger than 12.5 K in the model data, respectively, while corresponding low-level cloud amount decreases particularly in the LTS range most relevant for stratocumulus clouds (LTS 15 K). The displacement arrows from NCEP/ISCCP and iRAM are almost parallel within this LTS range, indicating that the model simulates the observed changes in the LTS– low-level cloud amount relationship during El Nin˜ o reasonably well. d. Interannual variations in low-level cloud amount and liquid water path To evaluate the response of the modeled low-level clouds to interannual variations in local thermal structure and circulation, we compare monthly mean cloud anomalies with other observed properties in the stratocumulus regions off the coasts of North and South America. Cloud properties of primary interest are lowlevel cloud amount and liquid water path as these are key parameters determining the cloud radiative properties. SST and LTS reﬂect the local thermal structure, while 500-hPa vertical velocities are indicative of largescale circulation changes. Figure 4 shows time series of anomalies in monthly mean low-level cloud amount, liquid water path, SST, LTS, and 500-hPa vertical velocities from iRAM in comparison with observations. Monthly mean anomalies are calculated by subtracting the average seasonal cycle calculated over the entire period. Observed low-level cloud amounts are obtained from ISCCP satellite data (Rossow et al. 1996); liquid water path from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI), and AMSR for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E; O’Dell 5854 et al. 2008); SSTs are taken from NOAA daily highresolution blended analyses (Reynolds et al. 2007); and LTS as well as 500-hPa vertical velocity are calculated from NCEP FNL data (NCEP–NCAR reanalysis before 2000; Kalnay et al. 1996). The time series cover the period 1997–2007 (for which we have satellite data for liquid water path and cloud cover) and are averaged over the southeastern Paciﬁc stratocumulus region (25 – 5 S, 100 –75 W, Fig. 4). The warm and cold ENSO episodes denoted by shading in Fig. 4 are based on observed Nin˜ o-3.4 SST anomalies. Even though they are averaged over a large domain, the monthly mean anomalies still show signiﬁcant variability. To reduce the noise introduced by the subseasonal variability we calculate 1-yr running means shown as thick curves in Fig. 4. SSTs in the southeastern Paciﬁc region show strong positive deviations from average values during the 1997/98 El Nin˜ o event and negative deviations from the average in the subsequent cold ENSO episode (Fig. 4c). From 2001 through 2006 SST anomalies are fairly small and it seems that the weak El Nin˜ os of 2002/03, 2004/05, and late 2006 have at most small effects on low clouds in the southeastern Paciﬁc. Both model and observations show a strong negative low-level cloud amount anomaly ( 8%) during the strong El Nin˜ o event in 1997/98 and a small positive anomaly (2%–3%) in the years 2002–04 (Fig. 4a). During the rest of the time period 1997–2007, the 1-yr running mean anomalies of observed low-level cloud amount are small. This behavior is reproduced by iRAM except for a 15-month period following the strong El Nin˜ o event of 1997/98 where the model predicts a positive low-level cloud amount anomaly of 4%. Anomalies in the liquid water path show a high positive correlation with low-level cloud amount anomalies (Fig. 4b). The top part of Table 3 shows correlations of the time series of the southeastern Paciﬁc region mean value of low cloud amount with other quantities averaged over the same region (using the 1-yr running mean of all quantities). The correlations of observed and modeled low-level cloud amount and LWP are 0.85 and 0.89, respectively. SST is strongly anticorrelated with observed and modeled low-level cloud amount with correlations coefﬁcients of 0.81 and 0.75, respectively. Figure 4d shows a comparison of modeled LTS anomalies with those calculated from NCEP data. The 1-yr running mean from iRAM agrees reasonably well with the FNL data, showing smaller than average LTS values between 1997 and 2001 and larger than average values thereafter. Earlier observational studies have shown that LTS is strongly correlated with subtropical low-level stratocumulus cloud fraction (Slingo 1980, 1987; Klein and Hartmann 1993). Correlation coefﬁcients for the modeled and FNL LTS with low-level cloud amount over the southeastern Paciﬁc stratocumulus region are 0.81 and 0.80, respectively. By contrast, 500-hPa vertical velocities (Fig. 4e) have a much weaker correlation with low-level cloud amount anomalies over the east Paciﬁc stratocumulus regions during the period studied here. Table 3 also gives the correlation coefﬁcient with domain-averaged SLP, which is 0.69 in observations but much smaller (0.19) in the iRAM simulation. We repeated this analysis for the averages over the northeastern Paciﬁc stratocumulus region (20 –30 N, 120 –130 W). In this region as well, there is a correlation of the SST with the ENSO state, notably with anomalously warm surface waters during the 1997/98 El Nin˜ o and cold water during 1999. The correlation coefﬁcients of low cloud amounts averaged over 20 –30 N, 120 – 130 W, with SST, LWP, LTS, SLP, and midtropospheric vertical velocity, are given in the bottom part of Table 3. These correlations are similar in the observations and in the iRAM simulation. The ability of iRAM to reproduce the interannual variations of cloud properties in stratocumulus regions through the ENSO cycle is much better than that of typical current coupled GCMs. Clement et al. (2009) showed that many global models have difﬁculties even in reproducing the correct sign of the correlations between cloud properties and meteorological quantities that we show in Table 3. Of course, the results in Fig. 4 and Table 3 involve iRAM run with prescribed SSTs and lateral boundary conditions and might be more directly comparable to prescribed SST GCM simulations than free-running coupled GCMs. However, the reality is that climate change experiments in AR4 have been performed with models that have poor representation of 5855 the mean cloud climatology in the eastern Paciﬁc stratocumulus regions and do not reproduce the connections between tropical and subtropical clouds and large-scale meteorological variables (e.g., Stowasser and Hamilton 2006; Clement et al. 2009). The much better cloud representation for current climate in iRAM provides the motivation for conducting the climate change experiments described in the next section. a. iRAM global warming simulations We estimate the response of clouds to global warming by calculating the differences between each of the three global warming cases A–C (see section 2) and our present-day reference experiment. We compare 10-yr means for each case [i.e., including only the last 10 yr (1999–2008) of the control run]. Figure 5 shows changes in low-level cloud amount as well as the imposed changes in SST for all three global warming cases. Also shown is the local cloud feedback parameter calculated as the change in net cloud forcing (CF ) divided by the change in surface temperature T : CF T . (1) The net cloud forcing is calculated as the sum of SCF and LCF, where SCF and LCF are calculated as the difference between the all-sky and clear-sky shortwave and longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere, respectively. Negative values correspond to a cooling effect on the climate system. Although this deﬁnition 5856 [Eq. (1)] of the cloud feedback parameter depends on changes in both cloud and clear-sky properties, such as changes in water vapor, temperature, or surface albedo (Soden et al. 2004), it is commonly used to diagnose global climate simulations because its calculation is straightforward and the cloud forcing deﬁned in this way can be estimated in a fairly direct way from observations (Bony et al. 2006). The spatial structure of the late twenty-ﬁrst-century SST warming patterns taken from the multimodel ensemble (case A), CGCM3.1 (case B), and CCSM3 (case C) are rather similar, but the overall magnitude of the warming differs quite signiﬁcantly among the cases (largest for CGCM3.1, smallest for CCSM3). In each case, the largest warming occurs in the equatorial east Paciﬁc and the smallest warming occurs in the southernmost part of our model domain between 20 and 30 S. Changes in the amount of low-level marine clouds calculated by iRAM in response to the global warming signals (cases A–C) have similar geographical patterns showing a strong decrease of 5%–10%, particularly in the two stratocumulus regions, and an increase in lowlevel cloud amount in the range of 2%–8% over the equatorial Paciﬁc between 150 and 100 W. Consistent with the amplitudes of the imposed global warming signals, case B shows the largest decrease in low-level cloud amount in both horizontal extent and amplitude, whereas case C has the smallest cloud response. The local cloud feedback parameters [Eq. (1)] are shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 5 and basically scale the cloud changes (speciﬁcally in shortwave cloud forcing) by the imposed SST changes. The feedback parameters are quite similar in cases A–C and are in the range of 4–7 W m K in the stratocumulus regions, 2 to 4 W m K over the equatorial Paciﬁc between 150 and 100 W, and about 1 W m K over much of the rest of the Paciﬁc. Clement et al. (2009) estimate a warming effect from changes in net cloud forcing because of changes in SST in the northeast Paciﬁc stratocumulus region (15 –25 N, 115 –145 W) of about 6 W m K . This observation-based estimate compares reasonably well to results from iRAM ranging between 4.2 and 5.9 W m K averaged over the same region (global warming cases A–C). As noted above, there is a strong similarity in the feedback parameters among the cases A–C, despite the different warming increments imposed in SST. However, it is possible that the close agreement in may depend on the overall geographic pattern of SST warming being similar among the three cases. This issue was investigated in a fourth experiment in which a uniform 2-K warming was applied to the sea surface throughout the domain and through the depth of the atmosphere on the lateral boundaries. The distribution in that experiment (not shown) was indeed rather different from that seen in cases A–C (the domain-average feedback in this uniform warming case was 3 W m K ). The red dots in Fig. 3a show the dependence of lowlevel cloud amount on LTS in the global warming simulation case A. The mean relation between LTS and low-level cloud amount is signiﬁcantly different in the perturbed climate from that in the control run. Speciﬁcally, in the warmer climate there are systematically smaller low-level cloud amounts for any given LTS value, except for a narrow region around LTS 14.5 K. Also the slope of the linear fit to results from the global warming scenario (0.025 K ) is somewhat smaller than that for the present-day model results or from observations. The model results suggest that the average relation between LTS and low-level cloud amount obtained from present-day observations over the east Paciﬁc can change signiﬁcantly in an altered climate. Application of simple models (e.g., Miller 1997) or parameterizations of the boundary layer cloud amount based on the observed present-day relation between LTS and low-level cloud cover may not be appropriate for climate change scenarios. The red curve in Fig. 3b shows the LTS PDF in the global warming simulation case A—compared with the present-day result there is a shift toward higher LTS values. Figure 3d shows the changes in the LTS–lowlevel cloud amount relationship between our presentday simulation and global warming case A. As for the 1997/98 El Nin˜ o case discussed above (Fig. 3c), average LTS and low-level cloud amount in the global warming case were calculated for the same model grid cells and months that were used to calculate low-level cloud amount for each of the present-day LTS bins. In other words, the blue dots for the present-day simulation in Fig. 3d are identical with the ones in Fig. 3a, whereas the red dots show LTS and low-level cloud amount values averaged over the same model grid cells but for the global warming case A. LTS increases in the global warming scenario for all bins while low-level cloud amount decreases for bins with present-day LTS values smaller than 13 K or larger than 16 K. However, lowlevel cloud amount remains close to its present-day level for the bins in the LTS range 13–16 K. Here, the increase in low-level cloud amount in the equatorial region between 150 and 100 W (see Fig. 5) balances approximately the decrease in low-level cloud amount within the same LTS range over other parts of the ocean. The general increase in average LTS is consistent with the reduction in mean tropospheric lapse rates and increased dry stability, which are robust predictions from current GCMs in a warmed climate. 5857 Figure 6 shows the mean diurnal cycles of cloudbottom and cloud-top heights for the core regions of the stratocumulus regimes over the northeastern (20 – 30 N, 120 –130 W) and southeastern Paciﬁc (25 –5 S, 85 –95 W). We deﬁne cloud-bottom height as the lowest level between the surface and 4 km at which the monthly mean cloud liquid water content exceeds 0.025 g kg and cloud-top height as the highest level at which LWC falls below this threshold value. The results shown have been averaged over the whole 10-yr period of the presentday simulation and the global warming scenario case A. While the cloud-bottom heights in the stratocumulus regions change only modestly, the average cloud-top heights in the global warming case (A) are about 50– 100 m lower compared with those of the present-day scenario. The vertical model resolution in the vicinity of the cloud tops over the northeastern Paciﬁc is about 200 m and over the southeastern Paciﬁc about 300 m. The overall thinning of the stratus cloud in the global warming case is consistent with the reduction in cloud shortwave forcing. To provide the thermal structure context for the cloud changes, an analysis of the vertical temperature proﬁle and lapse rate in the iRAM experiments is conducted. Conventional averaging with the vertical coordinate fixed in time and horizontal space will blur any marked feature of the vertical structure that is strongly variable in time (and horizontal space; Birner 2006). This blur effect makes the temperature inversion atop the MBL in the east Paciﬁc region hard to see in a multiyear climatology. Following the approach adopted by Birner (2006) to characterize behavior near the tropopause, we use the inversion layer base height as a common reference level to composite all temperature proﬁles. This is done by introducing a modiﬁed vertical coordinate deﬁned as z z with z as altitude and z as inversion layer base height. The data are interpolated from model levels onto vertical levels in z z with a cubic spline interpolation. Proﬁles that do not contain a temperature inversion in the lower troposphere (0–3 km) are not included in the average. The inversion layer base height is taken as the minimum temperature in this altitude range calculated from daily mean temperature proﬁles. Figure 7 (left panel) shows the results for the composited temperature proﬁles. We added the average of the inversion layer base height to the vertical coordinates shown in Fig. 7. The right panel of Fig. 7 shows the corresponding lapse rates ( dT / dz ). The mean inversion heights in the presentday iRAM simulation are about 1.4 km in the southeast Paciﬁc region and 0.7 km in the northeast Paciﬁc region. These are somewhat lower than the mean cloud-top heights presented in Fig. 6 (1.6 km and 1.0 km) as the mean heights for the clouds were computed including occasions when there is no well-deﬁned inversion and also depend on the threshold value for monthly mean LWC (see above). The drop in diurnal mean cloud heights by about 100 m in the southeast Paciﬁc and 50 m in the northeast Paciﬁc (Fig. 6) in the global warming simulation is paralleled by the very similar reductions in the mean inversion heights (Fig. 7). In contrast, our sensitivity experiment with a uniform 2 K increase in SST throughout the domain and in atmospheric temperatures on the lateral boundaries shows only a little change or slight increase in inversion layer base heights in the stratocumulus regions. This suggests that the reduction in mean tropospheric lapse rates predicted by the GCMs in a warmed climate (cases A–C) is important for the shallowing of the marine boundary layer in these regions. Analysis of the entrainment rates at the top of the boundary layer shows that entrainment in the global warming run is reduced by 9% in the northeast and by 12% in the southeast Paciﬁc stratocumulus region compared with the present-day simulation. Reduced entrainment could be a reason for the reduction in boundary layer height (e.g., Stevens 2006), causing the inversion 5858 to drop and the clouds to thin. Consistent with Caldwell and Bretherton’s (2009) hypothesis that a decreased radiative cooling of the boundary layer in an enhanced greenhouse case could cause the inversion to drop, we find average turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is less in our global warming run in both stratocumulus regions. In addition to less turbulence, entrainment could also be reduced by greater inversion strength in the global warming case particularly in the southeastern Paciﬁc stratocumulus region (see also Fig. 7). b. Comparison with IPCC model results We calculated the local feedback parameters for all 16 IPCC AR4 models that provided both TOA clear-sky and all-sky fluxes needed to compute TOA cloud forcings [Eq. (1)]. Just as for the other aspects of the global warming signal (see section 2), we calculate the change in cloud forcing due to global warming by subtracting 10-yr averages for the present-day simulation (experiment 20C3M, years 1990–99) from projections for the end of the twenty-ﬁrst century (SRES scenario A1B years 2090–99). Figure 8 shows a comparison of from IPCC AR4 models with the results from iRAM for global warming case A. The geographical patterns as well as the amplitudes of the local feedback parameters vary widely among the IPCC AR4 models. Of the 16 IPCC models, six of them [Centre National de Recherches Me´ te´ orologiques Coupled Global Climate Model, version 3 (CNRM-CM3); Institute of Numerical Mathematics Coupled Model, version 3.0 (INM-CM3.0); L’Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model, version 4 (IPSL CM4); ECHAM5–Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPI-OM); the third climate conﬁguration of the Met Ofﬁce Uniﬁed Model (UKMO HadCM3); and UKMO HadGEM1] simulate fairly strong positive local feedback parameters throughout most of the stratocumulus regions. By contrast, the Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organisation Mark version 3.5 (CSIRO-Mk3.5) and CCSM3 simulate fairly strong negative local feedback parameters in the two stratocumulus regions. The other IPCC models have feedback parameters in the stratocumulus areas that are either quite small (CGCM3) or that vary in sign through these regions. In other parts of the domain shown in Fig. 8 the simulated local feedback parameter differs greatly among the IPCC models. While the IPCC models disagree widely among themselves, none of the GCM simulated patterns of compare well with that in the iRAM simulation. The domain-averaged from iRAM is 1.8 W m K for global warming case A (1.9 W m K when averaged over ocean grid cells only). This positive feedback parameter mainly reﬂects the decrease in shortwave cloud forcing resulting from decreased low-level cloud amount and liquid water path. The response of clouds to global warming in cases B and C gives similar domain-averaged local feedback parameters of 1.8 and 1.9 W m K (2.1 and 2.0 when averaged over ocean grid cells only), respectively, even though the amplitude of the global warming signals varies signiﬁcantly among these cases. The domain-averaged changes in shortwave and net cloud forcing as well as the local feedback parameters for all global warming cases are summarized in Table 4. 5859 The light gray bars in Fig. 9 compare the local feedback parameters from the IPCC AR4 models averaged over the domain of the regional model (30 S–30 N, 150 –60 W) with iRAM. The domain-averaged feedback parameter simulated by iRAM is higher than that simulated by any of the 16 IPCC AR4 models. Out of the 16 IPCC models, 10 simulate positive feedback parameters for the east Paciﬁc region, and 6 predict a negative domain-averaged feedback parameter. The dark gray bars in Fig. 9 show the feedback parameter for each of the IPCC models averaged over the entire tropical– subtropical belt (30 S–30 N, 0 –360 ). The mean feedbacks in the entire tropical–subtropical belt in each model are fairly closely related to those for the east Paciﬁc domain (the correlation coefﬁcient over the 16 models is 0.95). The east Paciﬁc cloud feedbacks in the GCMs also correlate reasonably well with the equilibrium global climate sensitivities given in Table 8.2 of Solomon et al. (2007). The GCMs that have the highest east Paciﬁc cloud feedback (and hence are closest to the iRAM result) are the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate 3.2 (MIROC3.2), IPSL-CM4, and UKMO-HadGEM1. These (along with the medium-resolution version of MIROC3.2 not considered in this paper) are the GCMs with the highest global climate sensitivity according to the IPCC Table 8.2. It may also be noted that UKMO-HadGEM1 was identiﬁed by Clement et al. (2009) as the GCM that 5860 had the most realistic cloud responses to variations in the large-scale environment. We have examined the cloud simulations and cloud– climate feedbacks in the tropical and subtropical eastern Paciﬁc region in 16 state-of-the-art coupled GCMs and in the regional atmospheric model iRAM using prescribed boundary conditions. We find that the simulation of the mean cloud climatology for this region in the GCMs is very poor. The cloud feedbacks to imposed climate forcings vary widely among the GCMs in the east Paciﬁc and in the 30 N–30 S band in general. These variations account for a large fraction of the uncertainty in global climate sensitivity. Following Lauer et al. (2009), we have found that iRAM forced with observed boundary conditions simulates rather realistic mean cloud fields in the east Paciﬁc domain. Going beyond the earlier analysis of Lauer et al., we have also shown that the iRAM reproduces the observed interannual variations in cloud fields (as well as LTS), notably correctly simulating the response of the clouds through the 1997–99 El Nin˜ o to La Nin˜ a transition. By contrast, Clement et al. (2009) note that low clouds in GCMs generally do not respond realistically through the ENSO cycle. To investigate cloud feedbacks in iRAM, three global warming scenarios have been run with SSTs and horizontal boundary conditions meant to be appropriate for late twenty-ﬁrst-century conditions; speciﬁcally, warming signals based on IPCC AR4 SRES A1B simulations from 1) an ensemble mean of 19 GCMs, 2) the CGCM3.1 model, and 3) the CCSM3 model. All three global warming cases simulated with iRAM show a distinct reduction in low-level cloud amount particularly in the stratocumulus regime, resulting in positive local feedback parameters in these regions in the range of 4–7 W m K . The model results suggest that the reduction in stratocumulus clouds because of global warming is caused by a drop in average inversion layer base height and a consequential decrease in cloud-top height. As the cloud-base height remains approximately unchanged the decrease in cloud-top height causes the stratocumulus clouds to thin and liquid water path to decrease. This results in a less efﬁcient reﬂection of solar radiation and a reduction in shortwave cloud forcing— domain-averaged feedback parameters from iRAM range between 1.8 and 1.9 W m K (cases A–C). We have analyzed the relation between monthly mean low-level cloud cover and LTS in our iRAM simulations. The present-day simulation reproduces quite well the long-term mean relation in observations (NCEP data and satellite cloud retrievals). In both present-day iRAM simulation and observations, the El Nin˜ o perturbations in cloud cover are largely accounted for by the reduction in LTS. By contrast, in the global warming simulation the clouds and thermal structure change in such a way that the cloud cover versus LTS relation is signiﬁcantly different from the present-day simulation. This suggests that the decrease in low-level cloud amount during the 1997/98 El Nin˜ o, and the decrease because of global warming by doubled CO , is controlled by different physical processes as proposed by Zhu et al. (2007). Furthermore, this shows rather dramatically the inadequacy of cloud parameterization schemes based purely on present-day empirical relations between cloud cover and large-scale environmental fields. The cloud–climate feedback averaged over the east Paciﬁc region has also been calculated from SRES A1B simulations for 16 AR4 GCMs. The GCM feedbacks vary from 1.0 to 1.3 W m K , which are all less than the 1.8 to 1.9 W m K obtained in the comparable iRAM simulations. The iRAM results by themselves 5861 cannot be connected deﬁnitively to global climate feedbacks, but we have shown that among the GCMs the cloud feedbacks averaged over 30 S–30 N and the equilibrium global climate sensitivity are both correlated strongly with the east Paciﬁc cloud feedback. To the extent that iRAM results for cloud feedbacks in the east Paciﬁc are credible, they provide support for the high end of current estimates of global climate sensitivity. Acknowledgments.

Recent lunar formation models have suggested that volatile element depletion in the Moon resulted from the vapour phase falling back to the Earth . An important novelty of these models is that they predict the generation of a two-phase protolunar disk with high initial temperatures, and thus high vapour fraction , as a consequence of a high-energy giant impact . Such conditions in the disk might have favoured efficient mixing that led to the striking Earth–Moon isotope similarities (that is, O (refs. ), W (refs. ) (before late accretion), and nucleosynthetic anomalies (for example Ti (ref. ), Ca (refs. ), Cr (ref. ))) due to vigorous convection immediately following the impact, avoiding the need for an impactor that is unlike any known meteorite body . It has then been argued that volatile loss in the protolunar disk took place under such high-temperature conditions . Subsequent processes in the protolunar disk and after the Moon accreted (except for late accretion), such as condensation, evaporation or hydrodynamic escape of vapour above a lunar magma ocean, would have only modified stable isotope compositions in the form of mass-dependent fractionation . Therefore, while isotopic anomalies offer strong constraints on the dynamics of the initial stages of the protolunar disk, during which all isotopic signatures might have been homogenized to the terrestrial value, the study of moderately volatile element isotope compositions should provide insights into the later stage conditions of the Moon history. Investigation of mass-dependent fractionation of magnesium isotopes and silicon isotopes has shown identical Mg and Si isotope compositions for the Earth’s mantle and the Moon, whereas rubidium, gallium, potassium and zinc isotope systematics have revealed that the Moon is enriched in heavy isotopes compared with the Earth . This contrasting behaviour could reflect differences in volatilities between Mg and Si on the one hand and the more volatile Rb, Ga, K and Zn on the other. The Zn and K observations have been interpreted as resulting from kinetic isotope fractionation. There is a large range in Zn isotope data in lunar samples reported for mare basalts, magnesium suite rocks, ferroanorthosites (FAN) and pyroclastic glasses. The negative Zn observations reported for the pyroclastic glasses, FAN and some mare basalts can be interpreted as a result of secondary processes related to recondensation of volatilized Zn. In the case of mare basalts, leaching of this surficial Zn yields a Zn value identical to that of uncontaminated samples (see below). Enrichment in heavy Zn isotopes in the magnesium suite rocks and some FAN is thought to reflect at least two stages of evaporation following a global event. These late-stage processes that led to a large dispersion in Zn isotopes are not further discussed in this study. Rather, we focused on the large-scale process reflected in the rather homogeneous Zn isotope composition of low-Ti and high-Ti basalts ( Zn 1.4 ) as shown to be representing the bulk silicate Moon : this will be the Zn isotope composition we will be referring to in the remainder of this study. More specifically, this Zn isotope signature was initially thought to reflect a globalscale kinetic isotope fractionation and the interpretations were later refined and called upon isotope fractionation during vapour loss from a lunar magma ocean . In contrast with Zn isotopes characterized from a large data set, the difference in K isotopes in the Moon (from seven lunar rocks) relative to the Earth has been related to partial condensation of vapour in the protolunar disk . To better understand the depletion of moderately volatile elements in the Moon, we sought new constraints from another moderately volatile element, tin, which has different geochemical characteristics from Zn and K and a distinct speciation in gas and condensed phases. In this study, the Sn isotope composition of lunar rocks (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1) were measured for five low-Ti basalts, four high-Ti basalts and one norite using a recently developed highprecision method . The mean Sn value (where Sn is the normalizing isotope) and Sn concentrations for the low-Ti basalts are 0.56 0.06 (weighted 2 ) and 83 8 ppb, respectively, while the high-Ti basalts are characterized by a mean Sn concentration of 93 4 ppb and a mean Sn value of 0.54 0.06 (weighted 2 ). There is no Sn isotope difference between the low-Ti basalts, representing up to 70% of lunar magma ocean crystallization, and the high-Ti basalts, representing melts of a mantle source that formed after 95% crystallization . In addition, one sample (norite) from the Mg suite has a Sn value within error of those two lunar reservoirs. Thus, according to these observations and arguments developed in the Supplementary Information, the estimated Sn value of the bulk silicate Moon (BSM) is Sn 0.56 0.04 (weighted 2 , Supplementary Table 1). In contrast with the Zn and K isotope observations , all the lunar rocks show an enrichment in light Sn isotopes compared with the bulk silicate Earth (BSE). The tin isotope composition of the BSE has been estimated to be Sn 0.08 0.11 (2 ). Thus, the offset in Sn between the BSM and the BSE is Sn 0.48 0.15 (2 ). A larger negative offset is obtained using the data of Badullovich et al. ; however, their BSE value is not anchored on the same standard as that used in this study (further discussion in Supplementary Information). Using our new Sn concentration data in lunar rocks (Supplementary Table 1), the elemental depletion factor for Sn (Supplementary Fig. 4) in the Moon relative to BSE was shown to be 1/8, intermediate between that of K and Zn (ref. ), which is consistent with the condensation curve of Sn being intermediate between that of K and Zn over a wide range of pressures and temperatures relevant to the disk (Fig. 2). In what follows, we propose a single process to account for the elemental and isotope fractionations of K, Zn and Sn. Kinetic isotope fractionation during partial evaporation yields an enrichment in heavy isotopes in the source reservoir (the residual solid or liquid), and partial condensation yields an enrichment in light isotopes in the sink reservoir (the condensate) . Therefore, a kinetic isotope fractionation cannot be invoked to explain the observations if the three isotope systems are to be explained by the same process, given that samples representative of the bulk lunar mantle are enriched in heavy K and Zn isotopes whereas the Sn isotopes show an enrichment in light isotopes. Here, we have explored an alternative approach for producing the observed elemental depletions in Sn, K and Zn and the three associated isotope compositions in the BSM by considering global processes inducing liquid–vapour equilibrium isotope fractionation. One can imagine such a process in two contexts: (1) liquid– vapour equilibrium took place when the Moon had a degassing lunar magma ocean , resulting in equilibrium isotope fractionation between liquid and gas while vapour was lost by hydrodynamic escape; (2) in the outer part of the cooling protolunar disk, vapour was lost by a mechanism leading to liquid–gas separation after having reached equilibrium conditions between liquid and vapour. Equilibrium isotope fractionation is a function of temperature and depends on the nature of species in each phase of interest. To test these scenarios, we first need to determine the speciation of Sn, Zn and K in the liquid and the gas. For this purpose, we computed the speciation of the condensed phase using a thermodynamic approach . In the liquid, Sn is the dominant species in the I domain relevant to BSE and BSM compositions, for temperatures above 2,000 °C (Supplementary Fig. 1). In the gas, tin is mainly present as SnO (g), regardless of oxygen fugacity . With the information about the speciation of Sn in the vapour and liquid (Supplementary Information), one can show that the Sn isotope fractionation between the vapour and the liquid phases results in an enrichment in light isotopes in the liquid. If we consider the interpretation of the Zn isotope data for the lunar mantle represented by mare basalts (discussion above), on the basis of new determinations of the isotope fractionation factors between Zn (g) and ZnO (s) (ref. ) (which are the relevant species in the vapour and liquid), it is possible to infer qualitatively that, under equilibrium conditions, the condensed phase should be enriched in heavy Zn isotopes, in agreement with the Zn isotope observations . In contrast with Zn, there are no available isotope fractionation factors for K in the literature; K (g) is the main K vapour species over K-bearing silicate melt . To estimate the K isotope fractionation factor between the vapour and the silicate, we used the force constants for K O and for K in alkali feldspar (this clearly represents an approximation). This calculation shows that the condensed phase is enriched in heavy K isotopes (details in Supplementary Information). With these estimates of the isotope fractionation factors for Sn, Zn and K, it is possible to estimate the expected equilibrium isotope fractionation between vapour and melt. Overall, the isotope fractionation in one direction for K and Zn, and in the opposite direction for Sn, can be explained by an equilibrium process, and this stems directly from their respective speciation in the liquid (Sn, ZnO, K O) and in the vapour phase (SnO, Zn, K). I Had the isotope fractionation occurred in the context of the first scenario (vapour loss above a lunar magma ocean), the speciation of the liquid phase in equilibrium with the vapour would have been modified compared with the protolunar disk setting. Indeed, under the ( , ) conditions of lunar metal/silicate differentiation conditions, the major part of the tin budget will be in the magma ocean as SnO, as shown by studies of partitioning of siderophile elements in the Moon corresponding to the , conditions of a lunar magma ocean. The lunar core rapidly segregated tin as zerovalent Sn (metal) in the liquid metal (lunar core), leaving SnO as the only tin species in the silicate part of the Moon (lunar mantle), since metallic tin is not partitioned into silicate melt . Therefore, if Sn isotope fractionation had been associated with vapour loss in this context, SnO (g) would have equilibrated with SnO in the silicate part of the Moon, which could not have produced the observed lunar Sn isotope composition. Indeed, the Sn isotope fractionation factor between SnO (g) and SnO (l) is small ( 0.02 at 2,000 K; Supplementary Information) and in the opposite sense of what is required. In addition, equilibrium between Sn in the lunar core and SnO in the lunar mantle should enrich heavier Sn isotopes in the mantle. In this case, the value of Sn isotope of the bulk Moon would be slightly lighter than the observed BSM value. However, quantitatively, this isotope fractionation of Sn during lunar core formation is negligible (Supplementary Information). By contrast, in the second scenario (vapour loss at the protolunar disk stage), the speciation of tin should be considered in the context of vapour–liquid equilibrium between gas and liquid drops established under the physical ( ) conditions of the cooling protolunar disk. Using our thermodynamic predictions, Sn(0) is expected to be the major species in the condensed phase (Supplementary Fig. 1) while SnO is expected to be the main species in the vapour (Supplementary Information). We assume that liquid–gas equilibrium established in small enough moonlets, where no metal–silicate segregation was involved. Given the small magnitude of equilibrium fractionation factors of K, Zn and Sn at high temperature between liquid and vapour, we have considered a model where the equilibrium isotope fractionation is enhanced by repeated episodes of vapour–liquid equilibration followed by vapour removal from the system to the inner disk while the disk was cooling (Fig. 3). Various mechanisms of vapour–melt separation have been described . For example, if the vapour and liquid phases are vertically stratified and have different effective viscosities, they will radially separate from each other because they viscously spread at different rates and lead to volatile element depletion in the region beyond the Roche limit. Such difference of viscosity between phases could, for example, stem from the liquid phase being gravitationally unstable, in equilibrium with a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent vapour . In addition, gravitational interaction of the Earth with the proto-moons may prevent the volatile-rich elements from falling back to the protoMoon . A protracted Moon accretion could result from vigorous convection in the liquid–vapour mixture . In the outer part of the cooling protolunar disk, different physical mechanisms may separate vapour from liquid: viscosity differences , gravitational torque or gas drag on big droplets . Thus, the depletion in moderately volatile elements in the Moon could stem from equilibrium between droplets and subsequently removed vapour in the outer part of the protolunar disk. We performed thermodynamic calculations over a range of , , conditions to compute the distribution of Sn, Zn and K between I melt and vapour in the protolunar disk (Fig. 2). These results were used to model the Sn, Zn and K isotope compositions and elemental depletions of the liquid phase that is assumed to equilibrate with the vapour phase. By considering a multistage process of liquid–vapour equilibration after which the vapour is removed repeatedly, it was possible to match the observed mean Sn, Zn and K isotope fractionation between the Moon (as represented by the low-Ti and high-Ti basalt composition) and the BSE. The model could reproduce jointly the Sn, Zn and K in lunar rocks as well as the observed Sn (~1/8), Zn (~1/100) and K (1/5) depletion in the Moon relative to the BSE (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Information). Note that this model does not attempt to reproduce the large Zn isotope variations observed for example in FAN and pyroclastic green glasses that are caused by secondary processes occurring after the large-scale event. The conditions to reproduce the elemental and isotopic data were obtained for protolunar disks with initial liquid–vapour equilibrium temperatures of 2,400–2,700 K, followed by removal of the vapour, then another liquid–vapour equilibrium, while the system was cooling (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Information). This interpretation is also in qualitative agreement with Rb and Ga isotope observations that show an overall enrichment in heavy isotopes in lunar rocks relative to the BSE . As the Rb and Ga species in the vapour phase are Rb (g) and Ga O (g), respectively, both vapour species have a lower oxidation state than in the condensed phase (Rb O and Ga O , respectively) , which is again qualitatively consistent with the observed enrichment in heavy Rb and Ga isotopes in the condensed phase in equilibrium conditions. Recent models attempting to explain the depletion of the Moon in volatile elements, where dynamic simulations of the impact have been coupled with thermodynamics calculations, resulted in temperatures of vapour–melt separation up to 3,500 K . However, the liquid–vapour equilibrium range of temperatures obtained for our best fit to the observed elemental and isotope data for Sn, Zn and K is much lower. This difference is probably due to two factors. First, our calculations were done using activity coefficients from the FactSage or MELTS codes instead of those from the MAGMA code or GRAINS used previously. Second, earlier studies used the vapour pressure of pure molten silica instead of the actual vapour pressure of the complex silicate melt in the protolunar disk for their profile of the disk (see figures 2 and 3a in ref. ). While a full understanding of the conditions of volatile depletion in the Moon awaits a deeper investigation of the protolunar disk and of the processes associated with liquid–vapour equilibrium, Sn isotopes provide new perspectives compared with K and Zn isotopes. The new Sn isotope constraints suggest that Sn, K and Zn isotope compositions of the BSM (as defined in the preceding) cannot be explained by a vapour loss in the context of the lunar magma ocean. By contrast, volatile element depletion in the Moon could result from vapour separation in the protoplanetary disk stage and further suggests a relatively cold temperature for this process ( 2,500 K). These observations will require a better understanding of the processes of liquid–vapour separation during Moon formation.

Current projections of temperature-related mortality in the context of advanced aging are inadequate, and may underestimate the risks posed by global warming on people aged 90 years. The present study addresses this issue in Nantong City, which was the city in China with the highest aging and advanced aging rates in the 2000, 2010, and 2020 population censuses. Based on 27 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 and statistical downscaling methods, the impacts of climate change and advanced aging on future temperature-related elderly mortality were explored. Our results indicate that global warming will continue to increase the proportion of people who die from non-optimal temperatures even without considering the impact of advanced aging. Moreover, a higher warming range led to a more [SEP] significant [SEP] increase in net-temperature-related mortality and advanced aging is likely to increase heat-related mortality and offset the decline in cold-related mortality. Our study demonstrates a 1 1 > 2 effect between advanced aging and climate change, under the four shared socioeconomic pathway climate change scenarios considered here. These findings [SEP] contribute to a better understanding of the impact of climate change on elderly health and facilitate the development of more effective adaptive strategies for advanced aging societies. few studies have examined the effects of Global climate change and population aging are two prominent and interlinked concerns of the 21st century . The >1.2 °C global warming relative to preindustrial temperature, which has been driven by human activity , is a recognised challenge to public health. Climate change s direct (e.g., rising global temperatures have [SEP] significant [SEP] impacts on mortality, morbidity, and injury) and indirect (e.g., disturbance of social processes and ecosystem changes) effects pose immediate or deferred health risks to the human population . Several Studies have projected future temperature-related mortality under climate change, either at the city or national and global levels, based mainly on the increase in heat-related deaths caused by global warming. Contrastingly, low temperatures, particularly the interaction between cold and advanced aging (i.e., the increase in the proportion of people over 80 years), primarily because the frequency of low temperatures is expected to decrease in the future. However, the risks imposed by cold and heat do not increase equally with age. According to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data (https:// vizhub.healthdat.org/gbd-compare/), low temperatures accounted for a higher percentage of global noncommunicable deaths due to disease than high temperatures, with older age groups at a much higher risk of cold-related deaths than heat-related deaths. Our previous study showed that people aged 70 74, 80 84, and 90 94 who died from cold-associated conditions were at higher risk (2.75-, 4.84-, and 6.54-times, respectively) than those who died from heat-associated conditions . These results indicated that the effect of cold temperatures does not necessarily weaken with aging. Therefore, ignoring the effect of the cold temperatures on the trend of advanced aging could lead to severe public health consequences. Global population aging is accelerating because of declining fertility rates and increased life expectancy. According to the United Nations World Population Outlook 2022, the proportion of elderly individuals will increase globally by 60% from 2022 to 2050. China, for instance, became a moderately aging society in 2021 (aging rate 14%) and is estimated to become a severely aging society (aging rate 21%) by 2035, encompassing more than 400 million elderly people. Demographers predict that the aging rate and size of China s elderly population will continue to rise until 2055 and then stabilise. However, China s population over 80 years of age will continue to grow after 2055, remaining above 120 million from 2055 to 2100, i.e., 3 4 times higher than the 35.8 million registered in 2020, which accounted for 18.8% of the aging population. Under the medium-pace life expectancy growth scenario, this proportion is expected to be 24.2%, 35.6%, 40.0%, and 51.3% in 2040, 2060, 2080, and 2100, respectively. Advanced aging will thus become a substantial demographic issue in China in the second half of the 21st century. Aging plays a critical role in increasing temperature-related deaths . Yang et al. (2021) estimated 128,000 and 229,000 heat-related deaths in China in the 2090s under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios, respectively, with no changes in population demographics. However, these numbers increased to 361,000 and 654,000, respectively, under the average of the six population scenarios . Another study found that aging in Beijing would result in a 49 326% increase in temperature-related deaths due to cardiovascular disease in the future, which is the most prominent disadvantage in tackling climate change . Although population aging has been included in some studies focusing on the effects climate change may exert on mortality rates, none has considered changes in the 80 and 90 years population groups, which are the most affected by non-optimal temperatures. Failure [SEP] to include the oldest-old as an independent group in health risk projections related to climate change may therefore lead to a [SEP] significant [SEP] underestimation of health risks. The present study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dependent and interactive effects of climate change and advanced aging on heat, cold, and net-temperaturerelated deaths among the elderly in China s most heavily aging cities. [SEP] Specifically, [SEP] the present study projected these effects under 27 global climate models included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and four emission scenarios. Figure 1 displays the historical exposure-response relationship between temperature and the elderly population in different age groups. [SEP] Specifically, [SEP] the minimum mortality temperature (MMT) for the elderly population in Nantong increased with age. For the elderly aged 65 79, 80 89, and 90 , the MMT was 24, 25, and 26 °C, respectively. In comparison to MMT, the mortality risk (relative risk, RR) at the 2.5th percentile (1 °C) for the same age groups was 1.280 (95% [SEP] confidence [SEP] interval (CI):1.209 1.355), 1.708 (95% CI:1.583 1.844) and 2.217 (95% CI:1.981 2.480), respectively, and that at the 97.5th percentile (31 °C) was 1.192 (95% CI:1.139 1.246), 1.340 (95% CI:1.283 1.399), and 1.492 (95% CI:1.402 1.588), respectively. The temperature mortality associations were similar when we used 10 21 maximum lag days for temperature, 4 6 df for relative humidity, and 4 8 df for air pollutants (Supplementary Figs. 1 4). [SEP] Figure 2 presents an overview of the changes in the annual average temperature and frequency of extremely high temperatures in Nantong under four different climate change scenarios from 1961 to 2100. The shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0 scenarios demonstrate similar temperature increases before 2050, with projected annual average temperatures during 2041 2050 being 2.28, 2.27, and 2.24 °C higher than that during 1961 2000 (15.9 °C), respectively. However, temperature increases under these scenarios after 2050 exhibit [SEP] significant [SEP] differences. Hence, during 2091 2100, projected annual average temperatures are 2.51, 3.67, and 4.98 °C the highest higher than those during 1961 2000. Under i.e., SSP5-8.5, average annual temperature increase scenario, temperatures during 2041 2050 and 2091 2100 are estimated to be 2.78 and 6.51 °C higher than that during 1961 2000, respectively. The annual frequency of extremely high temperatures (i.e., above 31 °C) estimated under the four scenarios showed a similar trend to the average annual temperature. [SEP] Specifically, [SEP] under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, the annual frequency of extremely high temperatures during 2041 2050 is predicted to increase by 18.1, 17.8, 17.7, and 23.9 days, respectively, which are much higher values than the 6.6 days baseline of 1961 2000. More extended periods of extremely high temperatures are anticipated during 2091 2100, with increases of 22.2, 38.3, 56.8, and 80.2 days under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP37.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, when compared to the baseline period. Figure 3 presents a projection of the [SEP] age-specific [SEP] number of deaths under five [SEP] United Nations life expectancy models. The number of deaths among people aged 65 79 years will decrease steadily after 2040. In contrast, the number of deaths among those aged 80 89 and 90 years is projected to continue to increase. After 2055, the 90 years age group is expected to become the one with the highest number of deaths. Supplementary Fig. 5 presents a detailed projection for the [SEP] age-specific [SEP] number of deaths under the medium-pace life expectancy growth scenario and nine United Nations model life tables. Figure 4 shows the changes in the population-attributable fraction (PAF) of heat-, cold-, and net(heat and cold) temperature-related excess mortality under four climate change models, assuming no population changes. Under scenarios SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, the PAF of cold exhibits a continuous decrease whereas that of heat shows a continuous increase. Interestingly, under SSP1-2.6, the PAF of cold and heat remains stable after 2050, and under SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, the PAF of heat will not surpass that of cold until 2100. However, under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, the PAF of heat will exceed that of cold in the 2090s and the 2060s, respectively. The net PAF will continue to increase, with increase by projections indicating that 2.64%, 6.39%, 13.57%, and 29.46% compared to 2010 2019 values, under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. in 2080 2089 it will Figure 5 shows the [SEP] age-specific [SEP] changes in the heat-, cold-, and net-temperature-related PAF under the four SSPs, assuming no [SEP] population changes. Interestingly, the time at which the PAF of heat exceeded that of cold occurred later in older age groups. For instance, under SSP5-8.5, the PAF of heat is expected to surpass that of cold during 2040 2049 in the 65 79 years age group, during 2060 2069 in the 80 89 years age group, and during 2070 2079 in the 90 years age group. The net PAF will continue to increase across all age groups. For instance, the projected net PAF of 65 79, 80 89, and 90 years age groups under SSP5-8.5 during 2080 2089 is estimated to be 11.67 (95% CI: 8.78 14.75), 19.63 (95% CI: 15.93 23.95), and 25.90 (95% CI: 20.58 31.78), respectively, which are 1.50, 1.23, and 1.23 times higher than the corresponding values observed during 2010 2019. Figure 6 presents a holistic evaluation of the interactive effects of climate change and advanced aging on future temperature-related excess mortality rates. Overall, the net-temperature PAF increased under all four climate change scenarios and advanced population aging. [SEP] Specifically, [SEP] net-temperature-related excess mortality under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios assuming no population 13.86% (95% CI: estimated 11.39 16.25%), 14.30% (95% CI: 11.46 17.03%), 15.27% (95% CI: 12.13 19.38%), and 17.35% (95% CI: 13.94 21.42%), respectively, during 2080 2089. However, when advanced aging is considered, net-temperature-related excess mortality is estimated to increase changes at is 14.80 21.62%), 18.30% (95% CI: 18.77% (95% CI: to 14.95 22.47%), 19.86% (95% CI: 15.59 24.79%), and 22.05% (95% CI: 17.62 27.00%), respectively, during the same period. In addition, advanced aging is expected to increase the risk of nettemperature-related excessive mortality. Under the SSP1-2.6, SSP24.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the risk of net-temperature PAF is estimated to be 1.33-, 1.37-, 1.44-, and 1.62-times higher in 2080 2089 than in 2020 2029, respectively, whereas the risk was only 1.03, 1.07, 1.13, and 1.31 when advanced aging was not considered. Advanced aging is also expected to considerably In fact, weaken the decline of cold-related excessive mortality. under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0 scenarios, cold-related excessive mortality might increase during 2020 2089, 2020 2069, and 2020 2059, respectively. The time at which the heat PAF exceeds cold PAF is estimated to occur later when advanced aging is considered. These findings [SEP] emphasise the critical importance of identifying effective adaptation strategies to mitigate the risks of climate change-induced temperature-related excessive mortality, particularly in the elderly population. Table 1 presents a comparative analysis of PAF changes when considering the interactive effects of climate change and advanced aging or assuming their independent effects. The scenario assuming no climate change (independent effect of advanced aging) indicates that the temperature-related PAF will increase by approximately 30% by the end of the 21st century compared to [SEP] 2010 2019. On the other hand, assuming no population changes (independent effect of climate change), the temperature-related PAF is expected to increase by 1.87% (SSP1-2.6) to 39.29% (SSP58.5) at the end of the 21st century compared to 2010 2019. However, the combined effect of advanced aging and climate change was greater than the sum of their independent effects, particularly under heat-related PAF under the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Similarly, cold-related PAF increased in most periods under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios. The present study estimated an increase in net-temperaturerelated PAF in Nantong, China, by decade and under all four climate change scenarios considered; this trend will be strengthened by advanced aging. Our findings [SEP] indicate that advanced aging and climate change will increase heat-related mortality and reverse the declining trend in cold-related mortality. In Nantong, climate change is projected to lead to a continuous increase in the proportion of mortality attributable to non-optimal temperatures, under the assumption of no changes in population demographics. This is because climate change is associated with a decrease in moderately low temperatures (low RR) and an increase in extremely high temperatures (high RR), as indicated in Supplementary Table 1. Although the incidence of heat-related excess mortality is expected to rise globally in the future , it remains unclear whether climate change will result in positive or negative net annual mortality related to temperature. A study [SEP] the net lead to a net In Beijing, China, conducted across 23 countries revealed that climate change generally increases the mortality rate associated with non-optimal temperatures; however, the results also demonstrated [SEP] significant [SEP] regional disparities . annual temperature-related ischaemic stroke deaths were projected to surge by nearly 100% by the 2080s compared to the 1980s, regardless of population changes, under the RCP8.5 scenario . Similarly, research has revealed that climate change in Tianjin, China, will increase in deaths resulting from cardiovascular diseases attributable to temperature and that the increase in heat-related mortality will be higher than the decrease in cold-related mortality . A study conducted in New York, United States (US), revealed that climate change is expected to lead to positive annual net mortality related to temperature . Under the higher-emission RCP8.5 scenario, eight of the ten metropolitan areas in the US are expected to experience a net increase in temperature-related deaths per million people by 2086 2095 . Conversely, studies conducted in 28 cities in the US suggested that climate change will reduce the burden of temperature-related diseases and mortality . In Brisbane and Sydney, Australia, net annual temperature-related deaths are expected to increase in the future, whereas a slight decrease will occur in Melbourne . The present study s findings [SEP] are consistent with these previous conclusions, wherein most regions across the world had their minimum temperature-related mortality located within the 70 90% local temperature percentile, and the range of high temperatures was narrower than that of low temperatures . However, the relationship between temperature and mortality is affected by various social factors, such as the region s development and economic performance, urbanisation rate, population age structure, central heating, and usage of air conditioning , changes the magnitude of all contributing to different temperature mortality curves across regions and diseases. Furthermore, the temperature increase varies among world regions, resulting in different net-temperature-related mortality across them . A study on 15 diseases in Ningbo, China, projected a decline in deaths resulting from ten of those diseases, represented by chronic lower respiratory diseases, and an increase in deaths resulting from the other five [SEP] diseases, represented by ischaemic heart disease, attributed to climate change . In addition, whether the PAF of heat exceeds that of cold remains uncertain and depends on several factors that vary among regions, age groups, and causes of death. Research in the United Kingdom (UK) has shown that the number of people dying from low temperatureassociated causes is expected to be 13.0, 5.8, and 2.9 times higher than those dying from high temperature-associated causes in 2020, 2050, and 2080, respectively . Similarly, the present study found that the PAF of cold and heat is expected to vary among the different climate and population change scenarios analysed. This study examined the impact of advanced aging on the risk of climate change, particularly in people aged 90 years. Although the proportion of the oldest old is growing slowly, this growth rate will accelerate every year, becoming a serious social issue after 2050 in China and in Nantong City in particular. The 2050 2100 period is expected to be of intense warming under most climate-change scenarios. The present study found that advanced aging [SEP] magnifies [SEP] heat-related mortality, and that the interactive effect of heat and advanced aging is even higher than the sum of their independent effects. Additionally, advanced aging has an adverse effect on the declining trend of cold-related mortality, which has not been [SEP] identified [SEP] in previous studies. Previous research has shown that aging increases the risk of heatfi [SEP] related mortality owing to climate change. For instance, aging will aggravate the risk of heat-related mortality in Guangzhou, China, and every 1% increase in the proportion of the elderly population will increase heat-related years of life lost (YLLs) by 420 in the 2030s . Taking aging into account, the mortality from cardiovascular diseases in Beijing is expected to rise by 16.6%, 73.8%, and 134.0% in 2020, 2050, and 2080, the RCP8.5 scenario . Aging is also expected to lead to an increase in heat-related YLLs due to cardiovascular diseases in Ningbo, China, in the 2050s and 2070s . Research in the UK has shown that climate change has a [SEP] significant [SEP] impact on coldand heatrelated deaths among the elderly. Heat-related deaths are expected to increase sharply in the second half of the 21st century, whereas cold-related deaths will likely not decline [SEP] significantly. [SEP] A study in South Korea has found that regardless respectively, under of aging, temperature-related mortality in the 2090s is expected to be 0.5 1.5 times higher than that in 1992 2010, but it will experience a 4 6 times increase when considering population demographic changes . One review has shown that the elderly are particularly sensitive to climate change . Hence, advanced aging should be considered as a potentially [SEP] influencing [SEP] factor, especially after 2055, when people aged 90 years are estimated to stand the largest mortality. According to national population censuses in China, the number of deaths in people over 80 years old accounted for an increasing percentage (14.8% in 1990 to 38.5% in 2020) of total deaths, and people aged 80 89 years and 90 years are expected to become the groups sustaining the highest mortality during 2030 2060 and 2060 2100, respectively. This will lead to an inevitable increase in the excessive mortality attributable to non-optimal temperatures, and not accounting for [SEP] the different mortality rate of people in these age groups will underestimate the public health consequences of climate change. The results obtained in the present study have several major environmental and public health implications. First, irrespective of advanced aging, the net-temperature-related PAF will increase with increasing global warming, and it is urgent for governments worldwide to develop policies that eliminate greenhouse gas emissions to slow the pace of global warming. Second, coldrelated mortality will continue to increase, or at least not decline, owing to advanced aging, and ignoring the health risks of low temperatures will lead to serious public health consequences. local governments should play a positive role in Therefore, reducing the negative impact of cold on the aging population, especially in areas with high advanced aging rates. Third, our study revealed that advanced aging will increase temperature-related deaths among the elderly. Fourth, the time at which the PAF of heat exceeds that of cold varies among age groups and climate change scenarios, and people above 80 years of age will suffer more from cold-related mortality. Therefore, it is crucial to formulate both cold and heat prevention policies according to the local population structure and magnitude of warming. Overall, our findings [SEP] provide valuable insights for policymakers to develop effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change on public health and aging populations. further Our study had some limitations. First, population adaptation was not considered. Most previous studies have employed population adaptation scenarios where adaptation increases by a certain percentage per decade; however, the extent of this adaptation is uncertain and [SEP] difficult [SEP] to predict accurately . With economic development, and the increased use of air conditioning, people s adaptation to hot increasing urbanisation, the temperature exposure of and cold conditions will be strengthened . However, the lower frequency of moderate and extremely low temperatures expected in the future will weaken the people s adaptation to occasional extremely low temperatures . Second, new technologies such as wearable cooling equipment and new building materials may affect individuals and lead to discrepancies between the temperature measured by [SEP] official [SEP] outdoor temperature stations and the temperature to which people are exposed to. Third, all air pollutants could potentially affect the association between temperature and mortality. For example, the concentration of ozone in many Chinese cities has increased in recent years and is positively associated with temperature. This could potentially confound the effects of global warming on mortality and should therefore be considered in future studies. Finally, the present study was conducted in a city located in a north subtropical region and thus the results obtained cannot be generalised to geographic areas with different climates and population characteristics. MMT in Nantong city is increasing with age, but we cannot discern if it is an occasional, local phenomenon, or a general one. A nationwide study in Spain found that MMT decreased with age but varied with population, climatic characteristics, and socioeconomic conditions . However, the underlying mechanisms require further investigation. The research area chosen for this study was Nantong City (121°E, 32°N), located in the northern subtropics, and recognised as the pioneer of an aging society in China. Based on the fifth, [SEP] sixth, and seventh national population censuses conducted in 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively, the proportion of people over 65 years of respectively. This means age in the total population of Nantong was 12.44%, 16.50%, and 22.67%, the city has persistently maintained its position as the city with the highest proportion of old people among 340 cities above the prefecture level in China. In 2010 and 2020, advanced aging rates in Nantong were 3.65% and 5.15%, respectively, ranking first [SEP] among 340 cities nationwide. The [SEP] significant [SEP] increase in advanced aging rates and the large elderly population (over 1.7 million people over 65 years old in 2020) make Nantong one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change-related health risks. . Daily all-causes mortality data from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2017 were obtained from the Nantong Health Commission. The data were divided into three groups according to age: young-old (65 79 years, 105,746 records), middle-old (80 89 years, 108,623 records), and oldestold (90 years, 41,668 records). This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Nantong University (No. 2022(05)). No participants were contacted, and data were analysed at an aggregate level. Temperature and humidity data for the same period were collected from the National Meteorological Data Sharing Service Network and air pollutants data were collected from a local air quality monitoring station. . Regarding demography, the scale and number of deaths of the elderly population in a particular region are predicted based on three key parameters: life is for future projections life table, and migration. The primary expectancy, model parameter life expectancy, which determines the number of deaths in different age groups. A higher life expectancy will result in fewer deaths in the young-old and more deaths in the oldest-old. The secondary parameter is the model life table, which represents the mortality rate at [SEP] specific [SEP] ages for a given life expectancy. For the present study, the seventh population census conducted in 2020 in Nantong was selected as the base population. Information regarding the age structure of In the base population is provided in Supplementary Table 2. Nantong, the life expectancy in 2020 was 79.58 years, as provided by the National Bureau of Statistics, which was 1.65 years higher than China s nationwide average life expectancy (77.93 years) in the same year. Migration was not included in the present study because Nantong City maintained a migration balance from 1990 to 2020, According to China s population censuses, the annual net migration rates in Nantong City during the last three decades 0.755% were (2010 2020), which are much lower than those in most cities in China. Ageand [SEP] sex-specific [SEP] mortality rates between 2021 and 2100 were calculated according to future life expectancy and the model life table. Five UN life expectancy growth models (very slow, slow pace, medium pace, fast, and very fast) were used in the present study, starting from the 2020 study. The results obtained from these are presented in Supplementary Table 3. Nine commonly used model life tables were adopted to calculate the annual [SEP] age-specific [SEP] population and the [SEP] age-specific [SEP] number of deaths from 2021 to 2100. Each model life table represents a distinct ageand [SEP] sex-specific [SEP] mortality rate within the same life 0.204% (2000 2010), 0.492% (1990 2000), expectancy and would lead to different age structures in the future. These included four Coale-Demeny regional model life tables for developed countries (East, West, South, and North) and five [SEP] UN model life tables for developing countries (Latin, Chile, South Asia, General, and Far East). Calculations were as follows (1): , as determined by the predicted value of (1) refers to the mortality rate of the population aged in where year future life expectancy and the model life table; is the number of people represents the number of deaths in the aged in year ; and population aged in year . Population predictions were obtained using the PADIS-INT software (version 1.70), which is a widely used and recommended population prediction software by the UN Population Division. . The daily temperature prediction dataset for 1961 2100 under 27 General Circulation Models (GCMs, Supplementary Table 4) and four emission scenarios (SSP12.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) provided by CMIP6 were selected. The NWAI-WG statistical downscaling model was used to downscale the GCMs monthly grid data of the corresponding national meteorological station (No. 58259) in Nantong City into daily data . The statistical downscaling model consisted of three main steps: spatial downscaling, bias correction, and temporal inverse distancedownscaling. Spatial downscaling involves weighted interpolation based on the centre of the nearest four grid points in the GCMs to avoid multiple counties within a grid sharing the same projected value. Bias correction of the GCMprojected monthly values and historically observed temperatures was performed using the equidistant quantile method. Finally, a [SEP] modified [SEP] version of the stochastic weather generator was used to downscale the bias-corrected monthly GCM projections to the daily time series of key climate variables such as the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, and the daily average temperature of the 27 GCMs in Nantong was calculated. . Considering the lag effect and nonlinear relationship between temperature and mortality, the distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was used to assess the historical effect of temperature on mortality in the three age groups as follows (2): Log E Temp NS time NS DOW (2) Where represents the number of deaths on day ; is the intercept; the cross-basis function generated by DLNM was used for the daily average temperature with a natural cubic spline function (NS) by placing three knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of temperature, and an NS for the lag dimension (up to 14 days); is the [SEP] coefficient; [SEP] indicates the covariates, including relative humidity and two major air pollutants (PM and O ), which were adjusted using NS with three ; DOW is the day of the week. The parameters used in the DLNM model and the strategy for sensitivity analyses were similar to those used in our previous work . . To estimate the temperature-related mortality burden in 2020 2099, we incorporated 27 GCMs of CMIP6 to simulate the daily mean temperature using the historical temperature mortality relationship. We calculated the daily number of deaths from mean temperature exposure under different climate change scenarios. temperature (cold, heat, and net)-related Daily non-optimal mortality in the four different climate change scenarios was calculated using the daily number of deaths and the attributable fraction of non-optimal temperature, which was calculated as follows (3): RR 1 RR (3) Where, represents the number of coldor heat-related deaths in a future day [SEP] (defined [SEP] as temperatures below or above the MMT; MMT was [SEP] defined [SEP] as the [SEP] specific [SEP] temperature associated with the lowest mortality risk); represents the number of deaths on each age group (65 79, 80 89, 90 ) on a certain day in the future; is the age group (65 79, 80 89, 90 ); RR represents the mortality relative risk of the projected daily mean temperature relative to MMT. The sum of excess deaths for all cold and hot days is the number of deaths attributed to cold and heat, respectively, and the sum of both is the net effect of cold and heat. The attributable fraction (AF) was calculated by dividing the number of deaths attributed to non-optimal temperatures (i.e., cold and heat) by the total number of deaths. Monte Carlo simulations generating 1000 samples by assuming a multivariate normal distribution for the [SEP] coefficients [SEP] derived from the cross-basis function were computed to produce the empirical [SEP] confidence [SEP] intervals. The independent effects of advanced aging and climate change were [SEP] defined [SEP] by assuming no climate change or no population changes, respectively. Under the scenario of no climate change, the RR of daily coldand heat-related mortality did not differ from that during the historical period. Under the scenario of no population changes, the number of deaths at 65 79, 80 89, and 90 years ( ) did not differ from that during the historical period. The interactive effect was [SEP] defined [SEP] under scenarios of climate change and advanced aging, in which RR was calculated by comparing the projected daily mean temperature to the MMT, and was estimated based on the projections of age structure changes obtained in the previous step. test_npjcliac.pickle ---------- ['When, where, and which climate activists have vandalized museums'] Some climate groups have employed disruptive but non-violent tactics to draw public attention to the slow progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2022, a new disruptive tactic emerged: vandalizing art and museums. In this Brief Communication, we describe the key findings [SEP] which are based on an exhaustive search of media articles and social media postings. We find [SEP] that almost all 38 reported incidents occurred during May December 2022, with protests peaking around the COP 27 conference in Sharm El Sheikh, November 6 18. Once the COP conference was over, museum incidents dwindled to only three in December. Museum vandalism took place in eleven countries, nine of which are in Europe. Even within Europe, 60% of the incidents occurred in just three countries: Germany, Italy, and the U.K. We find [SEP] sixteen groups were involved in these incidents, but three groups account for 58% of them: Ultima Generazione (Italy and Vatican), Just Stop Oil (the U.K.), and Letzte Generation (Germany). Importantly, these groups are part of the A22 network, which suggests the possibility of some informal coordination on the staging and timing of museum events. None of the legacy environmental groups (such as Greenpeace) are involved in museum protests, although historically some have staged dramatic events to garner media attention. Environmental advocacy has existed for decades. Starting with the 1970 Earth Day protest to the more recent Greta Thunberg s Fridays for Future strikes and the Sunrise movement, activists have used protests, blockades, naming-and-shaming, boycotting, divesting, and litigation to bring attention to their cause . In developing countries, Indigenous Nations have protested against pollution and mining . In Indian Himalayas, the Chipko movement led women to hug trees to prevent their logging . Broadly, a well-developed literature examines repertoires . Scholars note that the [SEP] specific [SEP] tactics advocacy groups adopt depend on a variety of factors including the resources available to them, the political opportunity structure within which they can advocate [SEP] specific [SEP] causes , the characteristics of the advocates, and the characteristics of the target . social movement Activists target governments, corporations, and even citizens regarding climate policies and behaviors . Scholars note that media plays an important role in amplifying the social movement s message . Climate advocates have skillfully deployed both legacy media and social media . In part, the success of media coverage translating into public support depends on how the issue gets framed . Thus, narrative control is critical for the success of climate advocacy. In recent years, given the slow pace of emission reductions, some climate groups have resorted to non-violent but disruptive (NVD) action . We view this as radical in terms of tactics, though not necessarily in terms of their goals. Moreover, we recognize that the level of radicalness of different tactics varies, in part by the response they provoke from targeted actors. The tactical objective of NVD action is to generate widespread media coverage. These activists have sometimes stopped trains or disrupted [SEP] traffic [SEP] on major highways. They have blocked oil terminals or demonstrated near oil pipeline projects as in the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline . For some commentators, these actions are disruptive and confrontational and not likely to generate either public sympathy or policy change. After all, a lack of public awareness is not hindering climate progress. They believe that sources of opposition to climate policy are complex, requiring careful political negotiations instead of confrontation. Social movement scholars debate whether radical actions support or subvert movement goals . After all, most social movements have mainstream and radical (both nonviolent and violent) factions. Might even nonviolent radical action provoke a countermovement or provide a pretext for governments to crack down on social movement activists? For example, in response to the picketing of oil and gas infrastructure, about 17 U.S. states have enacted critical infrastructure laws that criminalize protests against fossil fuel pipelines. Other scholars suggest that radical action might for mainstream groups and therefore lead to policy action; this is sometimes called the radical flank [SEP] effect . The idea is that radical groups make mainstream groups look more reasonable and therefore persuade public [SEP] officials [SEP] to respond to their moderate demands. Thus, the radical flank [SEP] potentially changes the political opportunity structure that mainstream groups can take advantage of. increase support Recently, climate groups such as the Extinction Rebellion, Letzte Generation, and Ultima Generazione have employed NVD tactics to draw public attention to the slow progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2022, they began vandalizing art and museums, although in most cases the art pieces were not damaged. These actions which were carefully choreographed over social media, are designed to shock citizens, mobilize them, and compel governments to enact aggressive climate policies. Arguably, these protests should not be dismissed as emotional responses by actors with little policy radical activists professionally knowledge because sometimes Museum vandalism is predominantly a European phenomenon. These events took place in eleven countries, nine of which are in Europe: Germany Italy, the U.K., France, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, and the Vatican. Non-European countries, Australia and Canada, account for only 10% (four of the thirtyeight) incidents. Even within Europe, 60% (23) of the incidents Italy, and the U.K. occurred in just three countries: Germany, in 2022 we did not find [SEP] any museum vandalism Interestingly, incidents in the U.S., although some climate groups have employed disruptive tactics. Importantly, the absence of such events in the developing world which has well-established climate movements, raises important questions on how some tactics to raise public awareness might work in [SEP] specific [SEP] countries only. If museums are an important part of a country s cultural life, museum vandalism will probably receive extensive media coverage. In other countries where cultural life is located at the community level and not part of a formally organized structure, museum vandalism will probably not appear in the tactical repertoires of climate groups (Fig. 2). We find [SEP] sixteen groups were involved in these incidents. Organized groups (as opposed to individuals) are responsible for 95% (thirty-six) of incidents and they targeted museums in their countries of origin. Even among these, three groups account for 58% of these incidents: Ultima Generazione (Italy and Vatican) is responsible for nine, Just Stop Oil (the U.K.) for seven, and Letzte Generation (Germany) for six incidents. While these groups targeted museums in the countries in which they are located, they may have some sort of coordination mechanisms as well. The reason is that these organizations are members of the A22 network (https://ultima-generazione.com/a22network/). The A22 website notes: As the Last Generation, we will do whatever it takes to protect our generation and all future generations. As is our inalienable right. The old world is dying. We are in the last hour, the darkest hour. This world is being decimated before our eyes. We are in between moments. What we do now decides the fate of both this world and the next. The Climate Emergency Fund (https://www.climateemergency fund.org/a22), which is the lead funder for the A22 group, notes: In less than a year, most A22 groups had become the most prominent climate group in their home countries. Each group generated incredible amounts of press coverage and fundamentally changed the conversation around their chosen demand. In 2022, 23,000 press stories covered these 11 groups and their evaluate policy options by employing [SEP] scientific [SEP] knowledge . Thus, the museum vandalism tactic could be viewed as part of a wellthought-out plan to mobilize public opinion against fossil fuels. How many of such incidents took place? When, where, and who was responsible? To provide a comprehensive overview of the museum vandalism tactic, we describe the key findings [SEP] which are based on an exhaustive search of media articles and social media postings. We have posted the dataset on the Harvard (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset. xhtml?persistentId doi:10.7910/DVN/SAYIJ5). We find [SEP] that in 2022, thirty-eight incidents took place. None took place in 2021 and only three so far in 2023. Below are our key findings. [SEP] Dataverse Almost all reported incidents seemed to have occurred during May-December 2022. The first [SEP] museum incident took place on May 29 when an activist threw cake on the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. There were two incidents in June, five [SEP] in July, and six in August. After a lull in September with only one recorded incident, we find [SEP] nine incidents in October. Protests peaked in November with eleven incidents, eight of which occurred during the COP 27 conference in Sharm El Sheik, November 6 18. This suggests that activist groups, probably in some sort of informal coordination, sought to employ museum tactics to amplify the COP s climate message. Indeed, once the conference was over, museum incidents dwindled to only three in December (Fig. 1). Museum vandalism has almost stopped in 2023, with only three incidents to date: the smearing of paint over Degas Little Dancer in Washington DC and the Monet Painting at Sweden s National Museum as well as the pouring of diluted charcoal in the water of Rome s Trevi Fountain. demands! Thus, future work should examine whether [SEP] specific [SEP] acts of museum vandalism are part of a coordinated plan, or whether A22 members individually choose [SEP] specific [SEP] locations and times of action. In addition, three groups were involved in two museum incidents each, and the remaining ten engaged in one incident each. None of the legacy environmental groups (such as Greenpeace) are involved in museum protests, although historically they have staged dramatic events (such as boarding ships or unfurling banners from the top of prominent buildings) to garner media attention. This raises important questions such as whether legacy groups focus on [SEP] specific [SEP] types of NVD actions only, and why they are keeping away from the museum vandalism tactic (Fig. 3). Did these groups outline a [SEP] specific [SEP] demand? Just Stop Oil, Letzte Generation, and Ultima Generazione target the fossil fuel sector and want quick emission reductions. They typically do not advocate for a [SEP] specific [SEP] policy instrument to achieve this objective. In contrast, Scientist Rebellion, which participated in one incident, had a [SEP] specific [SEP] demand: the German government reinstate a speed limit. Futuro Vegetal, which organized two incidents, demanded the revocation of Coca-Cola s COP27 sponsorship. It appears that the less visible groups tended to make focused demand for a [SEP] specific [SEP] policy instrument or objective, while the more visible groups had a more generic message on climate change and reducing fossil fuel use. Martinez-Alier . differentiates among three types of environmentalism based on their origins, discourses, and tactics. The first, [SEP] the Cult of Wilderness [SEP] reflects [SEP] the traditional conservation movement that seeks to protect pristine nature, without paying adequate attention to who might bear the costs of such conservation measures. Second, the gospel of [SEP] eco-efficiency [SEP] advocates for ecological modernization coupled with economic and technological changes to move the modern industrial society towards sustainable development. The environmentalism of the poor, views environmental third type, problems from the prism of the poor and underprivileged whose daily lives are impacted by environmental destruction. The climate movement incorporates all three elements but where might we place museum protests? Given that these protests took place in rich countries and museums are not the sites where the livelihood of the poor (even in these countries) is impacted, they probably do not [SEP] reflect [SEP] the environmentalism of the poor. Moreover, given the demand for decoupling from fossil fuels, as opposed to sustainably managing them, it also does not fit [SEP] in the category of the gospel of [SEP] eco-efficiency [SEP] either. Arguably, and with some caveats, museum protests share some similarities with the conservation movement. Both seek to protect future generations by eliminating current economic activities. Conservationists sought to protect pristine nature by protecting it from logging and other economic interests. Moreover, like the conservationists, museum vandals do not pay adequate attention to distributional and justice issues (della Porta, 2015), [SEP] specifically, [SEP] how eliminating fossil fuel could increase energy costs which hurt the poor or communities dependent on the production or use of fossil fuels. Yet, unlike the conservationists, the museum vandalism movement employs outsider tactics. Its leadership is anti-establishment, as opposed to a part of it. Thus, museum vandalism, and NVD action in general, call for additional theorizing about the different types of radical tactics employed by the climate movement. This Brief Communication raises additional questions for the study of climate action. It is not clear whether museum vandalism is effective in spurring governments to adopt more aggressive climate mitigation policies, at least in the short term. On the face of it, drilling for oil and gas continues, Coca-Cola did not drop its COP 27 sponsorship, and the German government has not put speed limits on autobahns. Regarding the broader climate policy goals demanded by some groups, the effectiveness of a single tactic is [SEP] difficult [SEP] to evaluate because governments operate in a complex political environment. Moreover, with the Ukraine crisis, energy security issues may have temporarily slowed down the energy transition. What if the tactical effectiveness is evaluated in terms of the public support it generates? Many museum incidents were widely covered in both legacy and social media. Activists often made highly emotional statements. After gluing themselves to Vermeer painting in the Hague, Just Stop Oil activist said: "How do you feel when you see something beautiful and priceless apparently being destroyed before your eyes? Do you feel outraged? Good. Where is that feeling when you see the planet being destroyed?" . Some opinion polls suggest public disapproval of these tactics . it s completely nutty to German Chancellor Scholz said that somehow stick yourself to a painting or on the street . Directors of prominent museums released a statement noting: In recent in weeks, international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage . Will climate advocacy become more radical (both in terms of tactics and goals) over time if policy progress remains sluggish? Or there have been several attacks on works of art will it shift towards more collaborative approaches to work with both governments and firms? [SEP] The picture is unclear. In January 2023, Extinction Rebellion announced that it would temporarily pause disruptive protests. Other groups, such as Just Stop Oil and Ultima Generazione, however, are continuing with this tactic. Recent examples include the attempts at disrupting the Wimbledon and the British Open. Broadly, it seems two sorts of social repertoires will continue to flourish. [SEP] Mainstream movement groups will focus on established tactics such as protests, lobbying, boycotts, divestment, and litigation. In contrast, smaller organizations with social media skills will probably selectively engage in museum protests and other forms of dramatic NVD action. It remains to be seen whether the good cop/bad cop strategy, the radical flank [SEP] effect , will increase public support for the climate goals espoused by the mainstream climate movement and motivate additional governmental response to the climate crisis.
