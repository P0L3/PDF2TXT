10.1002/2013JD021394 The western North Paci c subtropical high (WNPSH) in boreal summer shows a remarkable enhancement after the early 1980s. Whereas the sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) and the equatorial eastern Paci c had been noted to have remarkable local or remote effects on enhancing the WNPSH, the in uence of the Atlantic SST, so far, is hardly explored. This article reports a new nding: enhanced relationship between the tropical Atlantic (TA)-SST and the WNPSH after the early 1980s. Regression study suggests that the warm TA-SST produced a zonally overturning circulation anomaly, with descending over the equatorial central Paci c and ascending over the tropical Atlantic/eastern Paci c. The anomalous descending over the equatorial central Paci c likely induced low-level anticyclonic anomaly to the west and therefore enhanced the WNPSH. One implication of this new nding is for predictability. The well-known spring predictability barrier (i.e., the in uence of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) falls dramatically during boreal spring) does not apply to the TA-SST/WNPSH relationship. The TA-SST shows consistently high correlation starting from boreal spring when the ENSO in uence continues declining. The TA-SST extends the predictability of the WNPSH in boreal summer approximately one season earlier to boreal spring. The western North Paci c subtropical high (WNPSH), a part of the North Paci c High, is a large-scale circulation occurring in the western North Paci c (WNP), which experiences a distinct seasonal cycle with a maximum strength and the northernmost position in boreal summer. Besides the seasonal cycle, the WNPSH exhibits a remarkable interannual uctuation, which substantially affects climate variability over the WNP and East Asia [e.g., Chang et al ., 2000; Wu et al ., 2010; Chung et al ., 2011]. Sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) and local air-sea interaction were suggested to be the main factors in contribution to the interannual variation of the WNPSH [e.g., Yang et al ., 2007; Yun et al ., 2008]. The WNP, the maritime continent, the northern Indian Ocean (NIO), and the equatorial eastern Paci c where El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs were the critical regions where the SSTA has notable local or remote effect on the interannual variation of the WNPSH in boreal summer [e.g., Wu et al ., 2010; Yun et al ., 2013; Wang et al ., 2013]. The in uence of the Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), so far, is hardly explored. Kucharski et al . [2007] showed that the warm SST in the tropical Atlantic (TA) generated vertical overturning circulation anomaly, with a large-scale descending in the Indian Ocean, and might suppress the convection in the Indian Ocean (IO) and weaken the Indian summer monsoon. Rong et al. [2010] pointed out that the warm TA-SST triggered atmospheric Kelvin wave and a low-level easterly wind anomaly over the equatorial Indo-Paci c, which might strengthen the WNPSH in the summer following an El Niño event. The TA-SST mentioned in Rong et al. [2010] was primarily driven by ENSO. Motivated by previous studies that identi ed a notable interdecadal change in the impact of ENSO/IO-associated SST on the East Asian monsoon [e.g., Zhou et al ., 2009; Ding et al ., 2010; Yun et al ., 2010], we will show in this study that the ENSO s impact on the TA-SST has been weakening since the late 1970s. That means the remote impact of TA-SSTA on the WNPSH is likely underestimated if only the ENSO-forced TA-SSTA is considered. In this study regular and partial correlation/ regression analysis was used to isolate the net impact of TA-SST on the WNPSH. Consistent results obtained from both methods reveal that the TA-SST contributes signi cantly to the enhancement of the WNPSH after the early 1980s. It was also found that the in uence of the warm TA-SST, well established in boreal HONG ET AL. 3715 spring, may overcome the so-called spring predictability barrier, a well-known phenomenon in seasonal prediction based on ENSO [e.g., Webster and Yang , 1992], and improve the predictability of the boreal summertime WNPSH. The observational data used in this study includes (1) monthly atmospheric data sets of National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis I [ Kalnay et al ., 1996] and (2) global monthly SST from NOAA Extended Reconstructed SST V3 (NOAA-ERSST-V3) [ Smith et al ., 2008]. Here the boreal summer is de ned as July and August (JA). June is not included because of the much weaker WNPSH interannual variance in June than that in July and August. Figures 1a and 1b show the distributions of the variance of the 850 hPa stream function in JA during the periods of 1948 1980 (hereafter P1) and 1981 2012 (hereafter P2). Two local variance maxima were identi ed: one located in the midlatitude North Paci c and the other in the subtropical WNP. The subtropical one is the focus of this study because uctuation in this region is closely related to the interannual variation of the WNPSH. The variance during P2 was evidently much larger than the variance during P1.The WNPSH index, used for measuring the strength of the WNPSH, is de ned as the averaged 850 hPa stream function anomaly over (15°N 25°N, 130 150°E), where local maximum variance is observed in Figure 1b. The time series of the WNPSH index (Figure 2a) shows that the WNPSH uctuates in both interannual and decadal time HONG ET AL. 3716 scales. Both the WNPSH time series and the envelope function of amplitude (i.e., 9 year running means of squared amplitude; Figure 2b) indicate a marked amplitude increase in the early 1980s, which is also clearly identi ed in the other data sets (Figure 2b). In order to objectively identify the regime shift, a regime shift index (RSI) [ Rodionov, 2004] was calculated to detect the speci c time of climate regime shift. Only when the RSI passing the 0.05 signi cance level a regime shift is detected [ Lo and Hsu , 2008]. The result (not shown) indicates that the envelope function of the WNPSH index underwent a signi cant regime shift in 1981 (color bars in the bottom of Figure 2b). The whole period was therefore divided into two periods, namely 1948 1980 (P1) and 1981 2012 (P2). A wavelet analysis of the WNPSH index further reveals a sudden enhancement of 2 5 years interannual variation around 1981 and also the enhanced 10 15 years interdecadal variation after the early 1990s (Figure 2c). Modulation of the interdecadal variation on the strength of the WNPSH in both interannual and decadal time scales is evident, i.e., the WNPSH amplitude increased signi cantly in P2. Because the interannual variation is the focus in this study, the decadal signals (9 years running means) were subtracted from the raw data in the following analysis. Note that different windows, e.g., 7 year and 11 year, for running mean were also applied and the results are essentially the same. The correlation map between the WNPSH index and the global SST during the period of P1 (Figure 3a) shows that the interannual uctuation of the WNPSH was negatively and positively correlated with the SSTA in the equatorial eastern Paci c (EEP) and the WNP, respectively, as mentioned in Wang et al. [2013]. However, a remarkable change occurred in P2 (Figure 3b): rst, the negative correlation with the EEP-SST shifted toward the central Paci c (5°S 5°N, 170°E 120°W); second, the SSTs in the NIO/WNP (0°N 20°N, 50 150°E) and TA (0°N 20°N, 25 80°W) became positively correlated with the WNPSH index. Previous studies [e.g., Yang et al ., 2007; Wu et al ., 2010] emphasized that the NIO-SST [e.g., Yang et al ., 2007; Xie et al ., 2009; Wu et al ., 2010] and TA-SST [e.g., En eld and Mayer , 1997; Alexander et al ., 2002; Huang et al ., 2002; Lohmann and Latif , 2007; Rong et al ., 2010] tended to rise in response to the remote forcing by El Niño that started in preceding winter. However, the sliding (21 years window) correlation coef cients between the ENSO index (i.e., averaged SSTA over 5°S 5°N, 170°E 120°W) in previous winter and the TA-SST index and the NIO-SST index in boreal summer (Figure 4) show that the ENSO s lagged impact on heating the NIO-SST increase gradually and becomes more signi cantly after late 1970s. On the contrary, the in uence on TA-SST has declined since the late 1970s. HONG ET AL. 3717 Figure 5 shows the regression coef cients of the TA-SST index onto stream function and velocity potential at 850 hPa and SST in JA for P1 and P2. During P2, the positive TA-SSTA was associated with anomalous cyclonic circulation in the tropical North Atlantic and the eastern Paci c, a pair of anomalous anticyclonic circulation in the western Paci c, and an east-west convergence-divergence dipole between the tropical Atlantic and Paci c (Figures 5a and 5b). This con guration can be interpreted as follows. The warm SST in the tropical Atlantic induced an east-west overturning vertical circulation with low-level convergence and upward branch over the tropical Atlantic and low-level divergence and downward branch over the central tropical Paci c. The upward and downward branches help maintain the low-level cyclonic circulation in the tropical Atlantic/ eastern Paci c and the anticyclonic pair in the western Paci c, respectively. The WNPSH is therefore enhanced. HONG ET AL. 3718 By contrast, the amplitudes of SST and velocity potential and stream function anomalies during P1 are weaker and are not as coherent as during P2 (Figures 5c and 5d). One notable difference between P1 and P2 is the SSTA in the eastern Paci c. The warm SST in the tropical eastern Paci c during P1 persisted from previous winter to current summer, while the warm SST during P2 weakened quickly and even turned into cooler state. The latter seems consistent with the recent ndings [e.g., Xie and Carton , 2004; Rodríguez-Fonseca et al ., 2009] that the warm TA-SSTA affected the SST in the equatorial eastern Paci c and helped the development of La Niña during recent few decades. It is hypothesized that this difference in SST between P1 and P2 likely resulted in the enhanced in uence of the TA-SST on the WNPSH. The neutral-to-negative SSTA in the tropical eastern Paci c during P2, although weak, was in a favorable state for enhancing (or at least not offsetting) the downward branch of the east-west overturning circulation. By contrast, the positive SSTA during P1 would partially offset the downward branch induced by the warmer TA-SST. It follows that the weakening SSTA signal in the tropical eastern Paci c and the strengthening SSTA signals in the TA after the early 1980s favor the enhancement of the TA-SSTA regulation on the WNPSH in boreal summer. Because the SSTs in the TA, NIO, and EEP are signi cantly correlated with each other (Table 1), partial correlation excluding the EEP-SSTA in preceding DJF and the NIO-SSTA in summer was computed and compared with regular correlation to evaluate the net in uence of TA-SST on the WNPSH. The partial correlation map in P2 (Figure 6a) shows that the warm TA-SST was signi cantly correlated with a pair of lowHONG ET AL. 3719 level cyclone in both hemispheres over the eastern Paci c and the Atlantic and a pair of low-level anticyclone nearly symmetric to the equator over the western Paci c. Similar characteristics are also seen in the regular correlation (Figure 6c), indicating that the summertime NIO-SSTA and EEP-SSTA in previous winter has little in uence on the TA-SST/WNPSH relationship. In contrast to P2, the TA-SST shows little correlation with the low-level circulation uctuation over the WNP during P1 (Figure 6b), suggesting the insigni cant impact on the WNPSH. Interestingly, the anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere extends further westward into South Asia and the Eurasian continent during P2, a feature also not seen in P1. Results of both regular and partial correlation analysis imply that the TA-SSTA has contributed more signi cantly to the enhancement of WNPSH since the early 1980s. Figure 6 alone does not exclude cleanly the effect of the ENSO. The concurrent correlations between the equatorial eastern Paci c SSTA and stream function in JA were also calculated. The circulation anomaly associated with the ENSO-like SST is almost orthogonal (not shown here) to the circulation anomaly seen in Figure 6. It follows that the TA-circulation relationship presented here is likely independent of the ENSO-like effect. Wang et al. [2013] pointed out the boundary forcing of April-May mean dipolar SSTA in the Indo-Paci c (i.e., SST difference between the IO and WNP) and the ENSO-SST tendency (May mines in March) are useful predictors in forecasting the intensity of WNPSH in boreal summer. The effect of the TA-SSTA was not discussed. One implication of this new nding reported here is for seasonal predictability. The WNPSH index in JA was reconstructed from the observed SSTs in the EEP, NIO, and TA individually, based on the linear regression between SST and the WNPSH index, during 1948 1980 and 1981 2012, respectively. Figure 7 shows the correlation between the reconstructed JA WNPSH index, which was derived from the SSTA in different leading months, and the observed JA WNPSH index. The correlation provides the predictability information. As shown in Figure 7, the predictability of the WNPSH provided by the EEP-SST is limited by the so-called spring barrier (note the minimum correlation in April-May) for both P1 and P2. The NIO-SSTA shows low correlation in boreal spring and summer during P1 but persistently higher correlation during P2. The prediction skill provided by the TA-SSTA shows a dramatic increase from P1 to P2. Comparing to the NIO-SSTA, the TA-SSTA shows persistently high correlation exceeding 0.5 from boreal spring to early fall HONG ET AL. 3720 during P2, a period when the ENSO in uence continued declining. The NIO-SSTA has notable but only concurrent in uence, because the correlation of NIO-SST becomes signi cant (e.g., exceeding 0.5) only until JA. Figure 7 shows that well-known spring predictability barrier does not apply to the TA-SST/WNPSH relationship after the early 1980s. The TA-SST extends the predictability of the WNPSH in boreal summer approximately one season earlier to boreal spring (February-March) after the early 1980s. The WNPSH in boreal summer shows a remarkable enhancement after the early 1980s. In addition to the in uence of the NIO-SSTA and EEP-SSTA on the WNPSH, this article reports a new nding: enhanced TA-SST/WNPSH relationship and possible enhanced regulation of the TA-SSTA on the WNPSH after the early 1980s. The results also suggest that the TA-SSTA can be used to extend the predictability of the WNPSH by a season and overcome the spring predictability barrier problem associated with ENSO. We hypothesize that the changes in the characteristics of SSTA in the EEP and the TA may be the main reason leading to the enhanced TA regulation on the WNPSH. The EEP-TA SSTA relationship changed after the late 1970s. Decreasing lagged correlation between the EEP-SSTA in previous winter and the summer TA-SSTA suggests weakening in uence of ENSO-type uctuation on the TA-SSTA. These characteristic changes in both TA and EEP SSTA are likely one of key reasons for the observed enhanced variability and predictability of the WNPSH. In addition, the recent NIO warming and enhanced NIO-SSTA/WNPSH relationship is also likely an important factor. Wang et al. [2013] reported the strong effect of the Indo-western Paci c atmosphere-ocean interaction mode on the WNPSH. Our companion study to the present one reveals that the TA-SSTA enhances the atmosphere-ocean interaction mode after the early 1980s. The observational analysis suggests that the increase of boundary forcing in the TA region contributes signi cantly to the enhancement of the WNPSH after the early 1980s. The enhancement of WNPSH is likely also caused by the other factors not discussed in the study. For example, the atmospheric circulation may response differently to the same TA-SST forcing in different mean states (P1 and P2). This issue cannot be resolved in this data diagnostics study, which is being investigated by numerical experiments. The results and the more complete physical processes involving the SSTA in TA, NIO, and EEP, which are also being explored, will be reported in a following paper.
