P D J N Extreme precipitation events (EPEs) can cause ﬂoods, waterlogging, and landslides, which have disastrous impacts on societies and ecosystems (e.g., Houze et al. 2011; Gochis et al. 2015). Accurately predicting these events is very important to minimize their associated risks; however, it is still a challenge for operational numerical weather prediction models (e.g., Ma et al. 2019). On a longer time scale, projections of EPEs by climate models have large uncertainties (Fischer et al. 2014; Pfahl et al. 2017). As a widely used strategy, identifying typical large-scale disturbance patterns associated with EPEs and understanding the related dynamic processes can help improve model simulations of EPEs. Numerous studies have examined the relationship between large-scale disturbances and EPEs in various regions. For example, summer EPEs over eastern China are usually related to the mei-yu front within the East Asian summer monsoon, the midtroposphere westerly jet, and low-level low pressure anomalies (Sampe and Xie 2010; Chen and Zhai 2014; Hu et al. 2019; Nie and Fan 2019, hereafter NF19). Moisture is transported by either the southwesterly jet southeast of the Tibetan Plateau from the Bay of Bengal or southeasterly winds along the southern ﬂank of the western Paciﬁc subtropical high (Qian et al. 2004; Zhou and Yu 2005). Over Pakistan and northern India, low-level monsoonal depressions transport moisture from the Indian Ocean and upper-level high-potential-vorticity (PV) intrusions enhance surface wind directed toward the mountains, and the combined effect of these two events causes heavy rainfall in this area (Hong et al. 2011; Lau and Kim 2012; Martius et al. 2013). Over the Mediterranean, the annual maximum daily precipitation usually occurs in winter when the subtropical high moves south and enhances the penetration of midlatitude synoptic systems (Raveh-Rubin and Wernli 2015; Dayan et al. 2015). Along the West Coast of the United States, EPEs are commonly associated with negative pressure anomalies in the central Paciﬁc Ocean, high pressure anomalies over the southwestern United States and the adjacent eastern Paciﬁc Ocean, and atmospheric rivers (ARs), which pump moisture from the tropical oceans (Zhu and Newell 1998; Lackmann and Gyakum 1999; Warner et al. 2012; Gimeno et al. 2014). Although numerous regional studies have investigated the synoptic situations of EPEs, only a very limited number of studies have examined these aspects of EPEs from a global perspective. These global-scale studies include the linkages between nocturnal low-level jets (LLJs) and EPEs (Monaghan et al. 2010), the role of ARs and LLJs in moisture transport in EPEs (Gimeno et al. 2016), and the statistical relevance of extratropical cyclones and fronts to EPEs (Pfahl and Wernli 2012; Catto and Pfahl 2013). Such global assessments are critical for understanding the regional features of EPEs, the geographic patterns of extreme precipitation climatology, and the responses of EPEs to climate change. Understanding the dynamics of EPEs at the global scale requires a uniﬁed diagnostic framework. In the extratropics, large-scale disturbances are strongly constrained by quasigeostrophic (QG) dynamics, and thus, the QG omega (QG ) equation is a useful tool for diagnosing and quantifying dynamic processes in EPEs. For example, the QG piecewise PV-inversion scheme has been used to determine the effects of upper-level PV anomalies on cyclones and heavy rainfall (Romero 2008; Schlemmer et al. 2010; Martius et al. 2013). The dry QG equation has been used to identify and quantify the role of adiabatic processes (i.e., temperature advection and vorticity advection) in extratropical cyclones (Deveson et al. 2002; Gray and Dacre 2006) and precipitation extremes (Milrad et al. 2010; Seastrand et al. 2015). Recently, latent heating by moist convection has been emphasized in the QG diagnosis of EPEs: diabatic heating has been found to cause more than half of the large-scale ascents of EPEs (Nie et al. 2016; Shaevitz 2016; NF19; Murthy and Boos 2020). This kind of QG diagnosis allows us to decompose an EPE into a drydynamic component (vorticity and temperature advections associated with the large-scale ﬂow) and a moist component (diabatic heating due to convection). The dry component can be further understood by examining the large-scale circulation features associated with EPEs, while the moist component is related to the local thermodynamic environments of convection (Nie et al. 2020). The goal of this paper is to provide a global QG diagnosis of extratropical extreme precipitation. This QG diagnosis is applied to climatological EPEs for each extratropical location. The multiyear composites represent robust features of each region, while the geographic distribution of the features reﬂects regional differences in the dynamics of EPEs. We focus on the following questions: 1) What is the contribution of each component (i.e., vorticity advection, temperature advection, boundary forcing, and diabatic heating) to QG and precipitation (section 3)? 2) Do the background or synoptic disturbances lead to more adiabatic-dynamic forcing of EPEs (section 4)? 3) What are the spatial characteristics of the synoptic disturbances associated with EPEs, and can a simple classiﬁcation capture these regional characteristics (section 5)? The data and methods are described in section 2. Section 6 provides a summary and discussion. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) dataset (Dee et al. 2011) is used in this study. Most variables are daily data between 1979 and 2016, with a horizontal resolution of 2.5 . Precipitation is from the ERA short-range forecast, which is available at a 12hourly temporal resolution. Here we use ERA precipitation for the selection of extreme precipitation events due to its better consistency with other variables. The ERA precipitation is validated by comparison with the satelliteand rain gauge–based GPCP precipitation (Global Precipitation Climatology Project version 1.2; Huffman et al. 2001) ranging from 1997 to 2015. For a given grid, an EPE in each year is deﬁned as the annual maximum daily precipitation averaged over a 7.5 7.5 regional box centered at that grid. The main results and conclusions are not sensitive to the size of the regional box, except that the amplitude of extreme precipitation (and its components) increases as the size of the regional box decreases. referred to NF19 for details; here, we only provide a brief description. The QG equation can be written as (e.g., Holton 2004) 1 (Adv ) Adv , (1) where is the dry static stability, is the pressure vertical velocity, is the Coriolis parameter, is the geostrophic absolute vorticity, and is diabatic heating. Adv and Adv are the horizontal advections of absolute vorticity ( ) and temperature ( ), respectively. Because ERA-Interim does not provide diabatic heating ( ), we estimate it as the residual term in the temperature budget equation. As the ﬁrst two righthand-side (RHS) terms in Eq. (1) require only the geopotential ﬁeld in the calculation, we call the sum of the two terms and boundary forcing as adiabatic-dynamic forcing ( ). There are several alternative forms for the forcing term in the QG equation, such as the Sutcliffe form and the Q-vector form (Davies 2015). The formulation in Eq. (1) has some shortcomings; however, by separating the vorticity and temperature advection terms explicitly, it allows us to examine the relative importance of the two terms, which may be associated with two types of cyclogenesis: the vorticity advection dominant type and the thermal advection dominant type (e.g., Petterssen and Smebye 1971; Gray and Dacre 2006). By solving the QG equation on a three-dimensional spherical grid by including each RHS term one by one, QG can be decomposed as , (2) where , , and are the vertical motions corresponding to vorticity advection, temperature advection, and lower boundary forcing, respectively, and and are the vertical motions forced by adiabatic-dynamic forcing ( ) and diabatic heating ( ), respectively. In solving Eq. (1), we use the spatial-dependent dry static stability ( ) instead of a constant value. In the calculation of , we solve Eq. (1) by setting the RHS terms to zero and the lower boundary condition as to be its value on the ﬁrst ERA pressure level above the instantaneous surface pressure. Thus, includes vertical motion in the atmospheric boundary layer. Vertical ascent can be further converted to precipitation via scaling as in O’Gorman and Schneider (2009): { ( / ) }, where {*} (1/ ) * is the mass-weighted integration over the troposphere, and the derivative of the saturation speciﬁc humidity ( ) is taken along a moist adiabat with the constant saturation equivalent potential temperature ( *). Thus, similar to Eq. (2), the amount of extreme precipitation can also be decomposed as , (3) where the subscripts denote the corresponding terms. We use the QG equation to quantify the factors that drive the vertical motion of extreme precipitation. The reader is In section 5, we apply the self-organizing map (SOM) analysis (Kohonen 2001), a clustering algorithm, to classify the characteristics of the synoptic-scale disturbances associated with EPEs. This unsupervised clustering method tries to minimize the average Euclidean distance between each sample in the dataset and the corresponding SOM pattern and has been widely used in the classiﬁcation of circulation patterns (Johnson et al. 2008; Lee and Feldstein 2013; Dai and Tan 2017). For each grid, we ﬁrst obtain the climatological variables of EPEs (a composite of 38 events from 1979 to 2016). The SOM is applied to the spatial pattern (120 longitude 40 latitude, centered on that grid) of the synoptic-scale (deﬁned later in section 4) 200-hPa geopotential height (GPH200). The patterns in the Southern Hemisphere are latitudinally ﬂipped, so that all the patterns are from the equator to the poles along the direction. Then, the patterns of all the grids between 20 and 70 N and between 20 and 70 S are normalized by their own spatial standard deviations and classiﬁed into six clusters based on the SOM method. Each grid is assigned to one particular SOM pattern with the minimum Euclidean distance. Table 1 shows the number percentage and the average pattern correlations between the SOM pattern and the members within each cluster. Using a larger number of clusters only leads to marginal increases of the pattern correlations and the conclusions are similar. We also tested the SOM analysis results using the combined variables of geopotential heights at 200 and 850 hPa, and the results are very close to those shown here. These sensitivity tests indicate the robustness of the clustering analysis and the relatively ﬁxed conﬁguration of the synoptic perturbations in EPEs. The climatology of the annual maximum daily precipitation from ERA-Interim is shown in Fig. 1a. To provide a reference for readers, the seasonal distribution of the days on which extreme precipitation occurs (referred to as extreme days hereafter) is shown in Fig. 2, although seasonal variation is not the focus of this paper. The results presented in Fig. 2 are consistent with the precipitation regimes summarized by Hsu and Wallace (1976). To list several notable regional features, over monsoonal regions, extreme days mostly occur in summer in each hemisphere. The distribution over the United States is characterized by two peaks in spring and fall. Over Northern Hemisphere (NH) oceans and the west coasts of continents, extreme days mostly occur in autumn and winter, while over Southern Hemisphere (SH) oceans a seasonal variation of extreme days is not obvious. The spatial pattern and magnitudes of precipitation extremes from ERA show reasonable agreements with those from the observation-based precipitation of GPCP (Fig. 1b). The spatial correlation between Figs. 1a and 1b is 0.92 and the root-mean-square difference is . Besides, the seasonal distribution of extreme 4.8 mm day day from GPCP (not shown) also share similar results to Fig. 2. Comparing Fig. 1c with Fig. 1a shows that the precipitation estimated from QG using scaling reasonably reproduces the extreme precipitation from the dataset (the spatial correlation between them is 0.90, and the root-mean-square difference is ). Obvious differences exist in several regions 6.0 mm day (Fig. 1d): the QG estimation overestimates the amount of extreme precipitation in some dry regions in the subtropics and underestimates it in monsoonal regions. These differences are due to the scaling (Pfahl et al. 2017) and the approximation of the actual by the QG . Nevertheless, the QG estimation captures the geographic distribution of extreme precipitation over most regions. Next, we examine the decomposition of extreme precipitation using Eq. (3). The adiabatic-dynamic component ( ; Fig. 1e) is small in low latitudes, where QG forcing is weak due to the small effects of Earth’s rotation. In midlatitudes, the geographic distribution of correspond well with the storm tracks, where active baroclinic waves and cyclones prevail. In the middle and high latitudes, the regional pattern of extreme precipitation is largely determined by that of . The distribution of the diabatic component ( ; Fig. 1f) is closely related to the distribution of , with the local maxima roughly equatorward of the local maxima of . The component shows larger amplitudes than in most regions, particularly in lower latitudes and over oceans, where precipitation is largely affected by latent heat release; also shows larger zonal heterogeneity than . It may be useful to view the diabatic heating during EPEs as a positive feedback on the adiabatic forcing (Nie et al. 2018, 2020). Diabatic heating feedback, deﬁned as / and presented as color shading in Fig. 1g, increases from less than 1 in high latitudes to more than 3 in low latitudes. Over oceans, is larger in the western part than for the eastern part, consistent with the distribution of sea surface temperatures. The spatial pattern of is highly correlated with precipitable water ( ) on extreme days (the gray contours in Fig. 1g). By simplifying the structure of large-scale dynamics of extreme precipitation and highlighting the dependence of convection on local thermodynamic conditions, Nie et al. (2020) proposed a simple model for the diabatic feedback so that /(1 ), where is a horizontally uniform coefﬁcient. The scatterplot of and ﬁts the simple model well (Fig. 1h), indicating the strong control of precipitable water on . Overall, the results of the extreme precipitation decomposition from the ERA-Interim (Fig. 1) largely agree with the results from the CMIP5 (phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) simulations in Nie et al. (2020) (their Figs. 2 and 4). The results presented in this section reveal the advantage of viewing EPEs as a system forced by large-scale adiabatic perturbations ( ) and ampliﬁed by diabatic heating feedback ( ). The two components can be examined separately. From this dynamic-forcing, diabatic-feedback perspective, we show that largely accounts for the geographic heterogeneity of extreme precipitation in middle and high latitudes, with moderate modiﬁcations by (comparing , , and in these latitudes), while in low latitudes extreme precipitation is mainly controlled by diabatic-heating feedback . The distribution of is largely determined by the distribution of precipitable water and explained by the simple model (Nie et al. 2020). In the following sections, we shall focus on the adiabatic component of EPEs. In this section, we examine the large-scale processes that determine the adiabatic-dynamic forced ascent ( ) and precipitation ( ). Figure 3 shows the decomposition of and based on Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. The corresponding components of and have similar spatial patterns. Both vorticity advection and temperature advection contribute to driving the large-scale ascent in EPEs, while their relative importance depends on regions. Over the North Paciﬁc, dominates in the eastern part while dominates in the western part. Over eastern North America and the North Atlantic, is uniformly distributed in the zonal direction, while the distribution of is northeast–southwest tilted. In the SH, both and are relatively homogenous in the zonal direction, while has larger amplitudes. Over complex topographic regions, such as the Tibetan Plateau, the Andes, and Greenland, is signiﬁcant (Fig. 3e) mostly due to topographic lifting. Note is not zero even in regions without apparent topography, since also includes ascent in the boundary layer in the decomposition of QG . We use a temporal separation to identify the dominant terms in the vorticity and temperature advections that drive the ascent in EPEs. Following NF19, we separate each meteorological variable into a background state (deﬁned as the means from day 13 to day 4 and from day 4 to day 13 around the extreme day) and synoptic disturbances (the total minus the background part). The background part (Figs. 4a,c) is close to the climatology of the monthly mean. In the lower troposphere, the background wind is eastward in midlatitudes and westward in high and low latitudes, except over the monsoonal region. The low-level background wind is southwesterly over the Indian Peninsula and southerly over East Asia. In the upper troposphere, the background wind is generally characterized by westerly wind, with local maxima coinciding with the climatological jets (Athanasiadis et al. 2010). Synoptic wind (Figs. 4b,d) is characterized by strong poleward wind throughout the troposphere in most regions. Meridional winds also have large amplitudes in the storm-track regions. With the temporal separation of meteorological variables, the advection terms can be decomposed into four parts: Adv* * * * * * , (4) where the overbar and prime symbols denote the background and synoptic parts, respectively, and an asterisk (*) represents temperature or vorticity. the meteorological variables of Because vorticity advection is stronger in the upper troposphere and temperature advection mainly occurs in the lower troposphere for typical extratropical cyclones (Deveson et al. 2002; Milrad et al. 2010), we examine vorticity advection at 200 hPa and temperature advection at 850 hPa in the following. For vorticity advection, the synoptic relative vorticity advection by background wind [RHS term 2 in Eq. (4)] is the dominant term (Fig. 5a). The other three terms of relative vorticity advection in Eq. (4) and the total planetary vorticity advection are weak. The sum of these terms (Fig. 5b) shows an opposite sign to the term in Fig. 5a for most midlatitude regions. For temperature advection, both the background and synoptic temperature advections by synoptic wind [RHS term 3 and RHS term 4 in Eq. (4)] are important. Because the two terms have similar regional features, we only show the total temperature advection by synoptic wind in Fig. 5c. The total temperature advection by background wind [RHS term 1 and RHS term 2 in Eq. (4); Fig. 5d] is relatively weak and has the opposite sign to that in Fig. 5c in most regions. Because synoptic wind is mostly poleward (Figs. 4b,d), synoptic wind and the meridional temperature gradient dominate temperature advection. Upper-level jets, storm tracks, and low-level baroclinicity zones are inherently thermodynamically (e.g., thermal wind balance) and dynamically (e.g., baroclinic instability) related (e.g., Chang et al. 2002; Athanasiadis et al. 2010). Here, we provide a qualitative argument for the geographic features of the dynamic forcing associated with EPEs. As shown in Fig. 6, strong meridional temperature gradients (baroclinicity) at 850 hPa are located in the western Paciﬁc and Atlantic Oceans in the NH and the midlatitude Atlantic and Indian Oceans in the SH (the similar features at 500 hPa and the annual mean are not shown). Together with large synoptic meridional winds (Fig. 4b), these regions have a large low-level temperature advection (Fig. 5c) and thus have a large temperature-advection-forced vertical ascent (Fig. 3d). The upper-level jets (Fig. 4c) coincide with the regions with large meridional temperature gradients (Fig. 6) due to the thermal wind balance. In the jet exit regions (collocated with the storm tracks), synoptic disturbances are active. These regions with large background winds and synoptic disturbances have large upper-level vorticity advection (Fig. 5a) and vorticity-advection-forced vertical ascent (Fig. 3b). The extratropical regional-scale EPEs are usually related to synoptic disturbances with particular characteristics. Numerous studies (e.g., Cavalcanti 2012; Dayan et al. 2015; NF19) have examined the synoptic features of EPEs in speciﬁc regions. For example, NF19 have used the same decomposition method as this paper to study EPEs and compared the synoptic disturbances in two speciﬁc regions. In this section, we examine several typical characteristics of the synoptic perturbations globally, including its intensity, wavelength, vertical conﬁguration, and propagation speed. These features have important implications for understanding the dynamics of EPEs. For instance, the forcing of vorticity advection is related to both the intensity of the synoptic disturbances and its relative location in the ridge/trough. The wavelength may indicate the type of synoptic disturbance, such as a large-scale PV intrusion or shortwave disturbance. The propagation speed and direction may indicate the origin of the synoptic disturbances and how long it will take to reach and leave the region under consideration. These synoptic characteristics may be compared with previous regional studies, and more importantly, provide a global picture with geographic distribution that may be further related with latitude, orography, and so on. Before showing the global picture, we ﬁrst demonstrate the synoptic disturbances over three example regions (Fig. 7). The consistent with previous regional studies of EPEs. For example, the synoptic patterns for region B along the west coast of North America are similar to the results in Warner et al. (2012) (comparing the middle column of Fig. 7a herein with their Figs. 7 and 11). The vertical proﬁles of and its components (Fig. 7b) over the three regions are consistent with the vertically averaged results in Figs. 1 and 3. It also shows that the residual term is relatively small. Metrics depicting the characteristics of the synoptic disturbances are introduced along with the examples in Fig. 7a. We quantify the intensity of synoptic disturbances on the upper level by the mean intensity of the nearest low geopotential height center (LHC; marked as black dots in Fig. 7a) and high geopotential height center (HHC), and on the lower level by the intensity of only LHC. The wavelength of synoptic disturbances is estimated by two times the distance between the nearest LHC and the nearest HHC. The synoptic disturbances show obvious westward tilt with height, a typical feature of baroclinic disturbances. Due to its lower latitude, region B is more barotropic (i.e., less tilt) than regions A and C, and synoptic geopotential height anomalies (Fig. 7a) show coherent and well-behaved structures: typical wave patterns in the middle and upper troposphere and distinct low pressure centers in the lower troposphere. The results in Fig. 7a are consistently, is less important in region B than those in regions A and C (Fig. 7b). We quantify the vertical tilt by the horizontal distance between the LHCs on 850 and 200 hPa normalized by the wavelength at 500 hPa. The intensity of the synoptic disturbances at 850 and 200 hPa are shown in Figs. 8a and 8b, respectively. The regions with stronger upper-level disturbances usually have stronger lowerlevel disturbances, indicating that the synoptic disturbances associated with EPEs are vertically coherent throughout the troposphere. The synoptic disturbances are weaker in low latitudes than those in middle and high latitudes, consistent with the smaller contribution of the dry dynamics to EPEs (Fig. 1). In middle and high latitudes, the synoptic disturbances are stronger over ocean than land, which result in the relatively heavier extreme precipitation over oceans. The wavelength of the synoptic disturbances at 500 hPa (L500; Fig. 8c) ranges from 3000 to 6000 km in the extratropical regions. The ratio of L500 to the Rossby deformation radius )/ , where 10 Pa and 2 [ ( s m Pa as a representative value in the free tropo10 sphere] increases with latitude (Fig. 9), indicating the growing control of the Coriolis effect on synoptic disturbances. Besides the Coriolis effect, which is the deterministic factor for the latitudinal variation, the synoptic disturbance wavelength is also affected by the background circulation. For example, the summer mean ﬂow in the western North Paciﬁc favors developments of shortwave synoptic disturbances (Li 2006). Background moisture and moist convection may affect the wavelength particularly in lower latitudes (Emanuel et al. 1994). For instance, along the similar latitudes, the subtropical dry-descending regions (i.e., the eastern South Paciﬁc and the South Atlantic Oceans) of the Hadley circulation have longer wavelength than moist-ascending regions (i.e., west Paciﬁc warm pool and the South Asian monsoon region) have. The regional features of L500 correspond well with the horizontal scale of the ascending anomalies in EPEs [cf. Fig. 8c with Fig. S3a of Tandon et al. (2018b) multiplied by 2 ]. With other conditions the same, synoptic disturbances with shorter wavelength lead to stronger most regions, LHC850 propagates eastward and poleward (Fig. 8f). Along the east coasts of North America and Eurasia, LHC850 mainly propagates poleward, indicating the strong steering effect of the subtropical highs. In low-latitude monsoonal regions, LHC850 propagates westward, consistent with the westward propagation of monsoon depressions, as mentioned in previous studies (Saha et al. 1981; Chen et al. 2005; Hurley and Boos 2015). The westward propagation of LHC850 in some high-latitude locations reﬂects the intrusion of vortexes from polar regions. We apply the method of SOM to better summarize the regional features of the synoptic disturbances of EPEs (see section 2c for details). Based on the classiﬁcation of synoptic GPH200, each grid is assigned to one of the six SOM clusters (Fig. 10). The classiﬁcation generally separates synoptic disturbances along different latitudes and between continents and oceans. Composites of synoptic-scale geopotential height anomalies for each cluster are shown in Fig. 11. A common feature among the SOM patterns is that the location of EPEs is to the east of low-level cyclone centers and moves toward the middle point of upper-level lows and highs, where vorticity advection is large. A comparison of the synoptic disturbances of the three example regions (Fig. 7a) to their corresponding SOM patterns (Fig. 11) validates the representation of the SOM patterns. There are also signiﬁcant differences among the SOM patterns. The characteristics for each SOM cluster are discussed below. In low latitudes, synoptic disturbances are mainly separated into two types: SOM 1 covers regions in the eastern Atlantic and Paciﬁc Oceans, North Africa, and the Mediterranean, while SOM 2 covers regions in the western Paciﬁc Ocean, Indian Ocean, Australia, and Mexico. Compared with SOM 2, SOM 1 is characterized by a slightly longer wavelength and smaller westward tilt as EPEs are located closer to the upper-level LHC (Figs. 8 and 11). In addition, the synoptic disturbances of both SOM patterns seem to originate from middle latitudes (Fig. 11; this is more obvious when extending the domain of the plots). The penetration of midlatitude synoptic systems and their interaction with tropical systems have been discussed in previous regional studies, for example in the North America monsoon region (Seastrand et al. 2015) and North Africa (Knippertz and Martin 2005). coupling between convection and large-scale dynamics, thus a larger diabatic heating feedback (Nie and Sobel 2016; Tandon et al. 2018a,b; Li and O’Gorman 2020). The vertical tilt of synoptic disturbances is shown in Fig. 8d (positive values denote westward tilt with height). The degree of tilt depends on the low-level baroclinicity, the type of cyclone, and its development stage (Deveson et al. 2002). The prevalent westward tilt is consistent with the canonical conﬁguration of the development stage of the midlatitude baroclinic disturbances (Charney 1947; Chang 1993), which indicates that precipitation maximum mostly occurs prior to the dynamical strength maximum of extratropical cyclones (Booth et al. 2018). The tilt seems to be anticorrelated with wavelength (Fig. 8c) and is large over midlatitude continents and their east coasts, with LHC200 lagging LHC850 by approximately 1/3. In low latitudes, the vertical axis of a synoptic system is almost vertical in both hemispheres, indicating more barotropic nature. The propagation speed of the synoptic disturbance in each grid is estimated by tracking LHC850 from day 1 to day 0. LHC850 propagates faster over middleand high-latitude oceans and slower over land and in low latitudes (Fig. 8e). In In middle and high latitudes, the synoptic patterns are mainly classiﬁed into four groups (Fig. 10). SOM 3 covers regions along the west coasts of continents and western Eurasia the and is characterized by a strong LHC throughout troposphere and a small westward tilt with height (Figs. 8 and 11). The relative position of EPEs to the low-level LHC corresponds to a southwesterly ﬂow (also see Fig. 4b), favoring moisture transport from oceans to the west coasts of land. This conﬁguration is consistent with previous EPE studies in the western United States (e.g., Lackmann and Gyakum 1999; Warner et al. 2012). The composites of SOMs 4, 5, and 6 are mainly different in wavelength (Fig. 11). In the SH, these composites occupy different latitude bands due to the weak land–ocean contrast, whereas in the NH they are mostly located in eastern continents and western oceans (Fig. 10). In the NH, the conﬁgurations represented by SOMs 4, 5, and 6 are marked by negative (positive) height anomalies to the southwest (east) of EPEs at all levels (Fig. 11), which produces a southeast or south ﬂow (also see Fig. 4b) and results in moisture transport from the oceans to the east coasts of land. The three SOMs are collocated with the baroclinic zone (Fig. 6) and are thus characterized by a large westward tilt of the synoptic system (Fig. 8d). In addition, compared with SOM 3, the wavelengths of the three SOM clusters are shorter and the intensity of the synoptic disturbances is stronger (Figs. 8a–c). The main characteristics of the SOM clusters discussed above are summarized in Table 2. This study presents a global and climatological diagnosis of extratropical extreme precipitation. The QG equation is used to decompose extreme precipitation into an adiabatic component ( ), which is associated with the vertical motion forced by large-scale adiabatic ﬂows, and a diabatic component ( ), which is associated with the vertical motion forced by diabatic heating in moisture convection. Diabatic heating can be viewed as a positive feedback on the large-scale adiabatic forcing. The spatial distribution of the diabatic feedback parameter ( ) can be largely determined by atmospheric precipitable water and is explained by a simple model. These analyses highlight the advantage of the dynamic-forcing diabatic-feedback perspective for understanding EPEs. The geographic distribution of largely resembles the distribution of extreme precipitation in middle and high latitudes, indicating that most spatial variations of EPEs can be explained by variations of large-scale adiabatic forcing there. Among adiabatic processes, upper-level vorticity advection is dominated by synoptic relative vorticity advection by background wind and is thus large in midlatitude jet and storm track regions; lowerlevel temperature advection is dominated by the total meridional temperature advection by synoptic wind and is thus large in regions with strong low-level baroclinicity; and boundary forcing is important in complex topographic regions. The characteristics of the synoptic perturbations associated with EPEs are globally examined. Using the SOM method, the synoptic disturbances in all extratropical grids are classiﬁed into six clusters: two clusters (SOMs 1 and 2) in low latitudes and four clusters (SOMs 3, 4, 5, and 6) in middle and high latitudes, separating the regions of the east, west, and interior parts of the land and ocean. In low latitudes, for regions in the eastern Atlantic and Paciﬁc Oceans and North Africa (corresponding to SOM 1), synoptic perturbations are characterized by a longer wavelength and a smaller westward tilt compared with other low-latitude regions (SOM 2). In middle and high latitudes, synoptic perturbations are characterized by a small westward tilt with its height along the west coasts of the NH continents (SOM 3) and feature a strong low-level baroclinicity and shortwave disturbances in eastern continents and western oceans (SOMs 4, 5, and 6). In the SH, the characteristics are nearly uniformly distributed in the zonal direction. The conﬁgurations of the synoptic systems favor moisture transport from ocean to land in coastal regions. Many regional studies have examined the circulation patterns associated with extreme precipitation for speciﬁc regions. The clustering results here provide the climatology of the circulation features for each region and can be helpful for comparing these climatological features around the globe. The diagnosis of EPEs based on the QG equation relies on several approximations. Differences exist between precipitation estimated from QG and precipitation from the reanalysis (Fig. 1d). These differences come from two parts: the approximation made in the scaling (Pfahl et al. 2017), which may be improved by including other physical processes, such as rain re-evaporating, in the scaling (Yin et al. 2020), and the non-quasigeostrophic ascent (differences between actual and QG ). The non-quasigeostrophic ascent is presumably due to smaller-scale dynamics excluded in the quasigeostrophic theory. Applying a theory with higher degree of accuracy (i.e., the semi-geostrophic theory; Eliassen 1950) may improve the reconstruction of at a cost of complexity. Since ERA does not provide the diabatic heating variable, we have to estimate it from the temperature budget equation, a process that also introduces errors. It is hard to quantify the contribution of each error source, and currently we lump them all into the residual term. Our results and previous studies (NF19; Nie et al. 2020) suggest that the residual is relatively small and does not affect the main conclusions of this paper. The global QG diagnosis of EPEs in this study can facilitate direct comparisons of the regional differences of the dynamic processes and synoptic characteristics of EPEs. Besides, the interannual variations of EPEs are related to low-frequency teleconnections, such as El Ni o–Southern Oscillation and the Arctic/North Atlantic Oscillation (e.g., Kenyon and Hegerl 2010; Sun et al. 2015; Whan and Zwiers 2017). The diagnostic method used in this study may help to understand how these teleconnections affect EPEs, for example, by affecting the adiabatic or diabatic components. In addition, the climate responses of EPEs to global warming show large regional variations and uncertainties, mainly due to changes in vertical motion (Emori and Brown 2005; Pfahl et al. 2017; Li and O’Gorman 2020). QG decomposition may provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamic processes and help to better understand the regional climate responses of extratropical EPEs.
