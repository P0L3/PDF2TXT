1. Enhanced relationship between the tropical Atlantic SST and the summertime western North Paciﬁc subtropical high after the early 1980s (JGR Atmospheres - 2014 - Hong - Enhanced relationship between the tropical Atlantic SST and the summertime western North.pdf) (2014.)
    - page number abrupts the text
    - alot of double whitspaces (due to fi cleaner) (not a problem)

    - abstract present in content 
2. The Instantaneous Retrieval of Precipitation Over Land by Temporal Variation at 19 GHz (JGR Atmospheres - 2018 - You - The Instantaneous Retrieval of Precipitation Over Land by Temporal Variation at 19 GHz.pdf) (2018.)
    - Missing last row of paragraph:
    ```
    The estimated instantaneous precipitation rate over the Southern Great Plains of
    United States from at 19 GHz reasonably agrees with the ground radar observations,
    with [the correlation, the root-mean-square error, and the bias at 0.49, 2.39 mm/hr, 
    and 6.54%, respectively.] ...

    ... is dimensionless time (Grinsted et al., 2004; Torrence & Compo, 1998). Additional details [about the CWT are given in Grinsted et al. (2004).]
    WTC is a correlation coefﬁcient localized in time and frequency space, which is used to quantify the degree of linear relationship between two nonstationary series in the time and frequency domains (Cazelles et al., 2008). Given time series X and Y, with wavelet transforms [W xi ðsÞ and W yi ðsÞ, the wavelet coherence can be] deﬁned according to Torrence and Webster (1998) as ...
