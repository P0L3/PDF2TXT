## Tested samples

1. Enhanced relationship between the tropical Atlantic SST and the summertime western North PaciÔ¨Åc subtropical high after the early 1980s (JGR Atmospheres - 2014 - Hong - Enhanced relationship between the tropical Atlantic SST and the summertime western North.pdf) (2014.)
    - page number abrupts the text
    - alot of double whitspaces (due to fi cleaner) (not a problem)
    - correct paragraph ordering, all text good
    - abstract present in content 
2. The Instantaneous Retrieval of Precipitation Over Land by Temporal Variation at 19 GHz (JGR Atmospheres - 2018 - You - The Instantaneous Retrieval of Precipitation Over Land by Temporal Variation at 19 GHz.pdf) (2018.)
    - Missing last row of paragraph:
    ```
    The estimated instantaneous precipitation rate over the Southern Great Plains of United States from at 19 GHz reasonably agrees with the ground radar observations, with [the correlation, the root-mean-square error, and the bias at 0.49, 2.39 mm/hr, and 6.54%, respectively.] ...

    - missing mathematica lsymbols
    - correct ordering of the paragraphs and text
