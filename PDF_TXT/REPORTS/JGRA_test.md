## Tested samples

1. Enhanced relationship between the tropical Atlantic SST and the summertime western North Paciﬁc subtropical high after the early 1980s (JGR Atmospheres - 2014 - Hong - Enhanced relationship between the tropical Atlantic SST and the summertime western North.pdf) (2014.)
    - page number abrupts the text
    - alot of double whitspaces (due to fi cleaner) (not a problem)
    - correct paragraph ordering, all text good
    - abstract present in content 
2. The Instantaneous Retrieval of Precipitation Over Land by Temporal Variation at 19 GHz (JGR Atmospheres - 2018 - You - The Instantaneous Retrieval of Precipitation Over Land by Temporal Variation at 19 GHz.pdf) (2018.)
    - Missing last row of paragraph:
    ```
    The estimated instantaneous precipitation rate over the Southern Great Plains of
    United States from at 19 GHz reasonably agrees with the ground radar observations,
    with [the correlation, the root-mean-square error, and the bias at 0.49, 2.39 mm/hr, 
    and 6.54%, respectively.] ...
    ```
    - missing mathematica lsymbols
    - correct ordering of the paragraphs and text
3. Attributes of mesoscale convective systems at the landocean transition in Senegal during NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses 2006 (Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres - 2010 - DeLonge - Attributes of mesoscale convective systems at the.pdf) (2009.)
    - Wrong paragraph ordering due to figures
    - no abstrat
    - Also includes figure text (not a problem)
    - No equations 
    - Figure text goes first (breaks the paragraphs if they are spred on different pages)
4. MultipleWavelet Coherence of World's Large Rivers With Meteorological Factors and Ocean Signals (JGR Atmospheres - 2019 - Su - Multiple‐Wavelet Coherence of World s Large Rivers With Meteorological Factors and Ocean.pdf) (2019.)
    - Page numbering occures in text
    - Missing last/first row of paragraph: (no wrong ordering)

    ... is dimensionless time (Grinsted et al., 2004; Torrence & Compo, 1998). Additional details [about the CWT are given in Grinsted et al. (2004).]
    WTC is a correlation coefﬁcient localized in time and frequency space, which is used to quantify the degree of linear relationship between two nonstationary series in the time and frequency domains (Cazelles et al., 2008). Given time series X and Y, with wavelet transforms [W xi ðsÞ and W yi ðsÞ, the wavelet coherence can be] deﬁned according to Torrence and Webster (1998) as ...

      - Probably a font problem?

Statistical comparison of properties of simulated and observed cumulus clouds in the vicinity of Houston during the Gulf of Mexico Atmospheric Composition and Climate Study (GoMACCS) (Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres - 2008 - Jiang - Statistical comparison of properties of simulated and.pdf) (2008.)
