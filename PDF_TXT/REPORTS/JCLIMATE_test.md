## Tested samples

1. Interactions between Vegetation and Climate: Radiative and Physiological Effects of Doubled Atmospheric CO2 (clim-1520-0442_1999_012_0309_ibvacr_2.0.co_2.pdf) (1999)
    - no abstract
    - missing subscripts
    - missing parts of text:
    ```
    The physiological responses to increased atmospheric ...
    ```
    - wrong paragraph ordering:
    ```
    lated to the model adjustment. After that, the land ...

    .
    large enough at times to obscure the physiological effects.
    [Begins with right paragraph and goes to the left then]
    Figure 3 shows the mean monthly surface air temperature response to increased
    ```
    - Has wrong ordered paragraphs (but they are consistent)
2. Local Regimes of Atmospheric Variability: A Case Study of Southern California (clim-jcli3837.1.pdf) (2005.)
    - no abstract
    - wrong ordering of paragraphs when first left paragraph begins at a lower position then first right paragraph (due to figures etc) -> not a problem while doing pretraining?
3. Interpretation of the Transient Variations in the Time Series of Precipitation Amounts in Seoul, Korea. Part I: Diurnal Variation (clim-1520-0442_2001_014_2989_iottvi_2.0.co_2_1_.pdf) (2001.)
    - No abstract
    - Missing first line of some paragraphs:
    ```
    Climatologically, heavy precipitation over Korea is
    ```
    - Missing last line of some paragraphs:
    ```
    riods with that of the dry period
    ```
    - Correct ordering of paragraphs (no occurance of situation like in 1 and 2)
4. Inferring Aerosol Cooling from Hydrological Sensitivity (clim-jcli-d-15-0364.1.pdf) (2016.)
    - no abstract
    - Minor text distruptions:
    ```
    The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that anthropogenic aerosol cooling 
    can be separated from the response to all other forcings using just their hydrolog
    [is demonstrated using] ical sensitivities.

    - Wrong pargraph ordering du to equations:
    ```

    ... tendency for aerosols to increase droplet concentration and decrease droplet 
    size, making clouds more reï¬‚ective.
    [characterized by a single time series a ( t ), called the response time series, 
    temperature and precipitation would be modeled as follows:] -> Should be in right 
    paragraph
    Observational estimates of global precipitation were obtained from the Global 
    Precipitation
    ```
    - Wrong paragraph ordering as in 1 and 2
5. Variability of the Cold Season Climate in Central Asia. Part I: Weather Types and Their Tropical and Extratropical Drivers (clim-jcli-d-17-0715.1_1_.pdf) (2018.)
    - no abstract
    - correct ordering of paragraphs and sentences
6. Pausing of the ENSO Cycle: A Case Study from 1998 to 2002 (clim-2007jcli1765.1.pdf) (2007.)
    - no abstract
    - correct ordering and full text
7. A Three-Dimensional Perspective on Extratropical Cyclone Impacts (clim-jcli-d-19-0445.1_1_.pdf) (2020.)
    - Wrong paragraph prdering due to figures (as in 1 and 2)
8. The Dependence of Radiative Forcing and Feedback on Evolving Patterns of Surface Temperature Change in Climate Models (clim-jcli-d-14-00545.1.pdf) (2014.)
    - Wrong paragraph ordering due to figures (maybe extract figure text for better text positioning)
9. California Winter Precipitation Change under Global Warming in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Ensemble (clim-jcli-d-12-00514.1(1).pdf) (2013.)
    - no abstract
    - Correct ordering of paragraphs (no 1, 2 situation)
10. Strengthened Connection between Springtime North Atlantic Oscillation and North Atlantic Tripole SST Pattern since the Late 1980s (clim-jcli-d-19-0628.1.pdf) (2020.)
    - no abstract
    - Wrong paragraph ordering due to figure


## Conclusion
- Papers ranging from 1999. - 2020. -> Relevant
- No abstract in any PDF (wrong extraction)
- Minor problem in text due to large spaces and justification
- **PROBLEM 1**: Should the correction of the ordering be considered?
