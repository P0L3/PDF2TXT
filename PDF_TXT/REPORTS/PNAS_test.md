10. A link between SIN1(MAPKAP1) and poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) in conteracting environmental stress (2008.)

## Conclusion
- All samples have full text with a correct order, correct authors and references
- **PROBLEM 1:** Acknowledgement text occures twice -> Should be parsed correctly
- **PROBLEM 2:** All texts seem to be written before 2012.?
- **PROBLEM 3:** Topic of the text seems to be far away from climate change?
