# CLIMD

## Tested samples
1. The WAMME regional model intercomparison study (s00382-009-0676-7.pdf) (2009.)
   -  Wrong column ordering
    ```
   UAM RegCM3 with HadlSST1 forcing produces near zero [Continues on new page
   instead of column on the other side] precipitation distributions. High
   correlations result when

2. Sensitivity of the Northern Hemisphere circulation to North Atlantic SSTs in the ARPE` GE Climate AGCM (s003820000061.pdf) (1999.)
   - Problems with larger spaces due to text allignment (Ignorable)
   - Occurance of (cid:128) which maps to "ff" in this text 
     - Check for others, add hardcode mapping for CLIMD?
   - Missing text with different font: example under 2 Construction of the SST anomalies
   - +--+
3. Modulation of tropical ocean surface chlorophyll by the Maddenâ€“Julian Oscillation (s00382-012-1321-4.pdf) (2011.)
   - Missing symbols from equations   
    ```
    The wind stress is estimated from CCMP daily wind data as C V V 1 where [MISSING
    SYMBOL p] is the density of surface air, C is the drag coefficient
    ```
   - No ff problems
   - Correct ordering except when too large whitespaces occure (ignorable)
   - ++++
