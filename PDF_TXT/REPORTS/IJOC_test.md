    2.3.1 Typical Meteorological Year
    A TMY consists of 12 concatenated months representing the typical climatological 
    conditions for a particular area.
    .
    .
    .
    More information on the generation of TMY can be found in the work of Abreu et 
    al. (2018).

    To assess the uncertainties in both MMEs, the analysis of variance described by 
    D´equ´e et al. (2007) was employed.

## Conclusion
- Not all samples have full text, most of missing text is from around equations or unavailable papers
- All samples have double instances for each author (not a problem)
- Samples were within the climate change topic and up to date (2012. - 2022.)
- **PROBLEM 1:** Missing text should be explored further -> Check why are the equations a problem and check why some text have only abstract
