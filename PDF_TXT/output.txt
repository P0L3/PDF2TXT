 Engineering crystals of dendritic molecules

 A detailed single-crystal X-ray study of conformationally flexible sulfonimide-based dendritic molecules with systematically varied molecular architectures was undertaken. Thirteen crystal structures reported in this work include 9 structures of the second-generation dendritic sulfonimides decorated with different aryl groups, 2 compounds bearing branches of both second and first generation, and 2 representatives of the first generation. Analysis of the packing patterns of 9 compounds bearing second-generation branches shows that despite their lack of strong directive functional groups there is a repeatedly reproduced intermolecular interaction mode consisting in an anchor-type packing of complementary second-generation branches of neighbouring molecules. The observed interaction tolerates a wide range of substituents in meta- and para-positions of the peripheral arylsulfonyl rings. Quantum chemical calculations of the molecule-molecule interaction energies agree at the qualitative level with the packing preferences found in the crystalline state. The calculations can therefore be used as a tool to rationalize and predict molecular structures with commensurate and non-commensurate branches for programming of different packing modes in crystal.

Revealing the interplay of noncovalent forces that direct processes of self-assembly and self-organization has been objective of numerous studies (1–4). This is central for the design and then the targeted synthesis of molecules capable of assembling into predefined supramolecular structures of practical significance. Although there are many examples in which the knowledge about the noncovalent interactions helped to arrive at predetermined complex molecular architectures (5, 6), the serendipity contributes to a large extent to supramolecular design. Once a new fascinating supramolecular structure is discovered, it is often difficult to decode the underlying principles of its assembly. In this context the crystallization of organic molecules is a specifically complicated case that remains poorly understood. Although it is now often possible with the aid of computations to predict a most favorable intermolecular interaction between molecules there is no guarantee that this particular intermolecular contact will be found in the crystal structure. Attempts at the rational design of organic crystals evolved into a nowadays well-established field of crystal engineering (7–11) that aims at general rules for crystal structure control. For the time being the field of crystal engineering has generated some knowledge that often helps to design organic crystals with desired properties. The main recipe is to use so-called “tectons” (12), which are small molecules with well-defined shape and strong directive functional groups, such as hydrogen-bonding units and metal-coordinating sites (13, 14). In case reproducible trends in crystal packing for a given group of compounds are observed the molecules are usually synthetically modified in a systematic way to influence the crystal structure. In this article, we report the first systematic structural study of flexible branched molecules lacking directive functionalities. This study relies on the single-crystal X-ray analyses of 13 structures of increasing branched complexity and is accompanied by theoretical calculations. The selection of objects for the present study was stimulated by both basic and applicative reasons. Indeed, the majority of dendritic molecules have low or no tendency to form crystals. There are only a few papers reporting single-crystal X-ray analysis of some dendritic structures of first (15–28) and second (29–34) generations. Although these results are highly interesting, there is still the lack of a premeditated structural study of dendritic molecules, which might shed some light on the factors controlling self-assembly of these flexible architectures. Dendritic molecules capable of self-assembly have potential applications as liquid crystalline and electronic materials (35–40). It is therefore important to be able to deliberately construct covalent and supramolecular architectures involving dendritic species. Recently, we demonstrated that sulfonimide-based dendrimers (41–43) can be precisely tailored with respect to their structural details enabling programmed analysis of the influence of small structural variations on a number of their physicochemical properties. The sulfonimide-based dendritic molecules are mainly crystalline solids with relatively high melting points, which prompted us to undertake a detailed study toward growing single crystals suitable for the X-ray analysis. Branched sulfonimides, such as 1-6 depicted in Scheme 1, bear multiple aromatic rings held together by sulfonimide branching points. The synthetic methodology affording this type of structures has already been reported by us (41) and synthetic procedures for the new compounds are collected in the SI. Crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray analyses were grown from methanol (compounds 1 and 2, 2 to 3 days, slow evaporation), dichloromethane/methanol (compounds 3, 5a, 5b, 5d, 5e, 5g and 6a, 2 weeks, slow evaporation; compound 4, 5 days, vapor diffusion), dichloromethane/methanol/acetonitrile (compounds 5c and 5f, 3 to 4 days, slow evaporation), and chloroform (compound 6b, 4 weeks, slow evaporation). Following the order of increase of molecular complexity, Figs. 1–6 depict the single-crystal X-ray structures of compounds 1–6 focusing on their packing in crystal. Parallel π-stacking involving 2-naphthyl groups with interplanar distances of 3.5 Å is present in crystal structures of simple sulfonimides 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). This type of intermolecular interaction is often observed in crystal structures of different aromatic compounds (1) and in some cases is regarded as a directional interaction, e.g., in crystal structures involving combination of aromatic and perfluoroaromatic rings (44) and other combinations of electron-rich and electron-deficient aromatic compounds (45). The directional role of the parallel π-stacking in the crystal formation in 1 and 2 is questionable because, as will be shown below, the π-stacking is not observed in larger dendritic sulfonimides. It is rather reasonable to assume that the parallel arrangements of the aromatic rings in crystals of 1 and 2 favor more compact packing and, consequently, the gain in cohesion energy. Compounds 3 and 4 are the simplest expanded branched analogues of 1 and 2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the packing of molecules of 3 and 4 in crystal involves the intermolecular anchor-type overlap of the complementary branches (shown in the dotted circles in Fig. 2 and schematically illustrated in Fig. 3). Additionally, like in the case of compounds 1 and 2, the parallel π-stacking involving naphthalene rings is also observed in crystals of 3 and 4. A detailed inspection of the intermolecular overlap of the complementary branches (Fig. 3) in crystals of 3 and 4 reveals that arylsulfonyl and p-sulfonimidobenzenesulfonyl rings in both structures are not parallel, which would be a prerequisite for an effective π-π-stacking. Instead, the rings are considerably tilted (the angle between the aromatic rings in 4 is 40°) that makes the intermolecular contact very compact and secures the efficient space filling. Symmetrical 5a–5e bearing small substituent in para or meta positions of the peripheral arylsulfonyl rings are representatives of the next branching event. Figs. 4 and 5 show the interactions of molecular pairs in crystals of compounds 5a–5c and 5d,e, respectively. Like in case of compounds 3 and 4, the most frequently observed molecule-molecule contacts in crystal structures of 5a–5c and 5d,e involve overlapping of their complementary branches. Notably, the molecular structure of 5e (Fig. 5 Middle) has the unusual conformation of the central sulfonimide branching point differing significantly from those found in all other dendritic sulfonimides. This noticeable conformational change at the central sulfonimide unit in 5e reflects an ease of geometric adjustability of branched oligosulfonimides to the crystal packing effects. Noteworthy, the unusual molecular conformation of 5e does not influence the characteristic intermolecular contact between the complementary branches (Fig. 5 Bottom), as in the case of 3, 4, and 5a–5d. Fig. 6 Top and Middle show packing of molecular pairs of second-generation unsymmetrical dendritic sulfonimides, so-called Janus-dendrimers (46, 47) 6a and 6b in crystal. Similarly to the above discussed symmetrical second-generation dendritic sulfonimides the intermolecular interaction consists of the overlapped second-generation branches. An interesting difference in the crystal packing of 6a and 6b is that the unlike branches of the former and the like ones of the latter are involved in their intermolecular contacts. The intermolecular contacts involved in packing of 6b in crystal are only the interactions of the complementary branches. As shown in Fig. 6 Bottom, this leads to the formation of channel-like structure with channels occupied by solvent molecules. Considerable sizes and matching shapes of the second-generation branches participating in the molecular packing of 5a–5e and 6a,b seemingly make the main contribution to the overall cohesion energy in their crystals. This type of intermolecular interaction, schematically depicted in Fig. 3, reproducibly observed in the 9 above mentioned crystal structures does not depend on the solvents that are either used for crystallization or present in the crystals. It therefore depends on the primary structure of the dendrimer. Although the rationalization of crystal structures on the basis of intermolecular interactions in molecular pairs is a rather dangerous venture, the repeated occurrence of the packing mode depicted in Fig. 3 in the 9 crystal structures prompted us to carry out a theoretical analysis of this type of interaction. In view of the recent comprehensive report by Dunitz and Gavezzotti (48) stressing the nonlocalized nature of intermolecular interactions, the following discussion of structural effects on the packing patterns in crystal structures of compounds 1–6 lacking strong directive sites relies on theoretically assessed molecule-molecule interaction energies rather than contacts between point atoms. The X-ray structural geometries were used as starting points in the full-energy minimization with a density-functional-derived self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding with dispersion term (SCC-DFTB-D) method (49, 50). The interaction energies were obtained by subtracting the sum of total energies of monomers from the total energy of the corresponding bimolecular complex. The calculations revealed that the interaction energy is sensitive to the nature of the overlapping branches. For instance, interaction energy calculated for the homodimeric complex of the interacting pair of 4-nitrophenyl-decorated branches, as in 4, is lower than that of the homodimeric complex of 2-naphthyl-decorated branches, as in 3, 5e, and 6b (−27.3 vs. −23.8 kcal/mol, respectively). The heterodimeric complex involving both 2-naphthyl- and 4-nitrophenyl-decorated branches, as in 6a, is the most stable in this triad (−28.0 kcal/mol). This agrees with the experimentally observed interaction of the unlike branches in the crystal structure of 6a. Interestingly, the calculated interaction energies of the intermolecular parallel π-stacking involving 2-naphthyl groups in structures 1 and 2 are −15.3 and −17.4 kcal/mol, respectively. These intermolecular contacts are considerably less stabilized compared with the one involving anchored branches. A reasonable explanation for these remarkably different calculated stabilities is that the interaction energy between charge distributions (48) in a molecular complex lacking directive functional groups seems to depend on the van der Waals area involved into intermolecular contact. The area of the intermolecular overlap of the second-generation branches is apparently larger than that of the π-stacked pairs involving naphthalene and p-nitrophenyl rings. Therefore, the interaction between complementary branches in crystal is favorable not only due to its compactness resulting in the efficient space-filling. It is also beneficial from the energetic standpoint. Consequently, on the basis of the consistent experimental and theoretical results we reasoned that introduction of second-generation arylsulfonyl groups that are not supportive of the repeatedly observed interaction depicted in Fig. 3, should change the packing in crystal. For example, analysis of molecular models of compounds 5f and 5g bearing 4-bromobiphenylsulfonyl and mesitylsulfonyl peripheral groups, respectively, shows that the overlap of second-generation branches in these compounds should be highly unfavorable, if not impossible. It is expected that in compound 5f the 4-bromobiphenyl units would stick far out of the branch-to-branch contact under study and lead to open arrangements in the crystal. The resulting voids would, however, be too small to be filled by some solvent molecules to compensate for the cohesion energy loss. In case of compound 5g, the interaction under study is impossible merely because of its sterically loaded second-generation branches. According to the model calculations, the o-methyl groups of the peripheral mesitylsulfonyl units should lead to significant changes in the conformation of the corresponding sulfonimide branching point changing at least one Car-S-N-S torsion angle from its equilibrium value of 90° (41) to ≈150°. In line with the expectations, crystallization and the subsequent single-crystal X-ray analysis of compounds 5f and 5g revealed that their packing in crystal does not involve the overlap of the complementary branches, as depicted in Fig. 3, repeatedly observed in the 9 above discussed structures. Fig. 7 shows that although the X-ray molecular structure of the compound 5f is very similar to those of 5a–5d, its molecules pack in crystal in parallel stacks, which are in turn complementary to each other. The resulting structure is dense: It does not contain voids, and no solvent is present in the crystal. The calculated interaction energy of the X-ray revealed molecule-molecule contact of 2 superposed 5f is −49.3 kcal/mol. This value of the interaction energy is significantly lower than the value of −22.0 kcal/mol calculated for the visionary branch-branch contact involving 2 molecules of 5f. Similarly to the above discussed case of the different calculated stabilities of the branch-branch interaction and the π-stacking of naphthalene rings, this is seemingly due to a considerably increased van der Waals area of the intermolecular contact in 5f compared with that of the repeatedly observed branch-branch contact (Fig. 3). Summarizing this tendency, the structures lacking strong directive functionalities (e.g., hydrogen-bonding centers) tend to maximize the area of mutual overlap in molecular pairing. In accord with the model considerations, X-ray molecular structure of 5g (Fig. 8Top Left) has 2 conformationally distorted sulfonimide branching points. This makes the commonly observed packing mode (Fig. 3) physically inadmissible. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the packing of 5g in crystal generates voids occupied by CH2Cl2 solvent molecules. Although the packing of 5f and 5g in crystal could not be predicted on the basis of both available crystal structures of other second-generation dendritic sulfonimides and theoretical calculations, one can reliably calculate the molecular structure and conclude on the feasibility of the packing modes. Finally, the n-octyl chains present in all of the structures under study do not seem to play any critical role in determining the packing in crystal. The chains exhibited significant disorder in most of the presented X-ray structures. The intermolecular contacts involving the aliphatic chains and aromatic rings revealed negligible calculated stabilization energies (−2.0 to −3.0 kcal/mol) compared with those of the above discussed intermolecular interactions. In stark contrast to the vast majority of dendritic molecules that have low or no tendency to crystallize dendritic oligosulfonimides have the advantageous ability to form single crystals with no regard to the peripheral substitution. This allowed carrying out the unprecedented correlation of molecular and crystal structures of flexible dendritic species. The conclusions drawn in this contribution rest upon single-crystal X-ray analyses of 13 dendritic sulfonimides with systematically modified molecular architecture and accompanied by theoretical calculations. The compounds showed reproducible and tunable packing modes in the crystalline state. An unlimited structural diversity of dendritic oligosulfonimides (41–43) makes them highly promising flexible building blocks for crystal engineering. Properly shaped and functionalized dendritic sulfonimides could possibly be used in topochemistry and the rational design of materials, such as conducting organic crystals (51, 52). Our approach to the diversity of dendrimer crystals can be equally applied to other types of branched compounds, providing their molecular structures can be tailored in a systematic way. We are now focusing on crystallization of larger generation dendrimers and the growing of dendrimer cocrystals. The synthesis of the compounds discussed in this work was either reported in refs. 41–43 or carried out following the published methods. Detailed synthetic procedures and characterization data for new compounds are in the SI. Single-crystal X-ray analyses were performed on an Xcalibur PX CCD diffractometer. The details of the crystallographic data and summary of data collection and refinement for the dendritic sulfonimides are also given in the SI.
