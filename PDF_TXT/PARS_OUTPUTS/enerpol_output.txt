['(cid:1)', '1. Introduction', 'Spurred by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 the deregu- lation of the US electricity supply is happening quickly: 24 states and the District of Columbia have already enabled electricity competition (Swezey and Bird 2000) while others are reviewing such possibilities. Already millions of retail customers and small businesses in the United States have the opportunity to choose among competing electricity suppliers. Like any other consumer service or product consumers will evaluate product at- tributes and prices and choose the service most to their liking; products with attributes more pleasing to con- sumers will be able to charge a premium.', 'Given the higher prices typically associated with many renewable energy sources and with technologies that', 'reduce pollution from fossil fuel energy sources there has been considerable speculation about the fate of renew- able and more environmentally benign energy sources in deregulated electricity markets both in the United States (Wiser', 'et al', '. 1998) and in Europe (Fouquet 1998; Eikeland 1998). Wiser', 'et al', '. outline three policy mecha- nisms that can support renewable generation sources: (1) portfolio standards mandating minimum levels of renew- able energy use; (2) energy support programs funded by distribution surcharges; and (3) consumers', "'", 'voluntary renewable energy purchases in response to green market- ing. Of these three methods however reliance upon green marketing is the most precarious because it relies upon the demand of a price sensitive consumer populace. Consumers', "'", 'responsiveness to price in a market with undi', '!', 'erentiated products is well understood. However consumers', "'", 'willingness to pay higher prices to obtain electricity service with certain environmental character- istics is not well understood but such an understanding is essential for predicting the success of various energy generation sources in a deregulated market and for help- ing regulators maintain an appropriate mix of renewable support policies.', 'In order for green marketing of electricity to work in the sense of tapping consumers', "'", 'willingness to pay higher prices for electricity with fewer environmental impacts information concerning the environmental character- istics of individual electricity services must be communic- ated to consumers. Many state governments in the United States have already taken initial steps to develop such consumer-friendly information policies and have established requirements or are considering establishing requirements that mandate environmental disclosure by electricity generating', '"', 'rms. For example Illinois', '"', 'rms must insert quarterly updates of their purchased fuel mix and projected air emissions in customer billings and post these updates on the internet (Illinois Commerce Com- informative disclosure mission 2000). Another less prototype has emerged in the California markets in which', '"', 'rms are required to display only a standard fuel', 'mix disclosure in all direct mail and internet advertising', '(Senate Bill 1305 California Statutes of 1997); emissions data communications are not required. Environmental disclosure provisions are required or are under consid- eration by about half of the states and have been included in proposed federal deregulation legislation (Regulatory Assistance Project 1999).', 'Given the prevalence of current and proposed green marketing programs in residential electricity service and the importance of initial renewable demand in establish- ing a sustainable development pattern for renewable generation capacity (Fouquet 1998) it is crucial to understand the elements that will shape consumer de- mand for various types of electricity services. While con- sumer-driven demand for', '&', 'green labeled', "'", 'electricity has bloomed in countries such as Sweden (Eikeland 1998) the potential for such change in the United States has not been fully assessed.', 'The purpose of this paper is to provide some insight into US consumers', "'", 'demand for deregulated residential electricity services that promise more favourable envir- onmental pro', '"', 'les. We present results from a survey de- signed to elicit consumers', "'", 'willingness to pay for changes in the environmental characteristics of residential elec- tricity service using price and environmental disclosure statements similar to those used in the emerging de- regulated electricity markets in the United States. We then compare these results to the actual price premiums that have emerged for green electricity in several de- regulated US markets and discuss the implications of these results.', '2. Consumer survey', '2.1. Sur', 'v', 'ey methods and analysis', 'The data are drawn from responses to a survey instru- ment featuring numerous questions concerning electric-', 'ity use awareness and intentions and featuring several experimental tasks (see Winneg', 'et al', '. 1998 for a com- plete summary of the survey results). The experiment of interest involves simultaneously presenting respondents with information disclosures sheets (Fig. 1) for two hypo- thetical electricity services and having the respondent choose the one they would buy. The attributes of the electricity services include monthly price contract terms fuel source mix and air emissions pro', '"', 'le. All attributes except contract terms were randomly assigned to each information disclosure sheet so that no two respondents saw the same pair of services. This survey follows the tradition of conjoint analysis a research technique tradi- tionally used by marketing experts to help design and price new consumer goods (Green and Srinivasan 1990) and more recently wielded by economists to value envir- onmental attributes not priced by the market (Roe', 'et al', '.', '1996).', 'One thousand and one adult respondents were recruit- ed from shopping malls in eight di', '!', 'erent US cities: Cin- cinnati Ohio; Holyoke Massachusetts; Houston Texas; Jacksonville Florida; Riverside California; Philadelphia Pennsylvania; Portland Oregan; and Salt Lake City Utah. A pro', '"', 'le of respondent demographics is presented in Table 1.', 'Analysis of consumers', "'", 'willingness to pay for various environmental amenities of the electricity products is based upon 835 usable responses and follows techniques developed by Roe', 'et al', '. (1996); complete details of the analysis are available from the authors upon request.', '2.2. Sur', 'v', 'ey results', 'The estimated willingness to pay', '"', 'gures (Table 2) sug- gest that the median consumer from several di', '!', 'erent demographic segments is willing to pay more for mar- ginal alterations in the fuel sources and pollution outputs of an electricity generation service.

Drawing upon simple extrapolation of the under-', 'lying linear model allows us to impute a median willing- ness to pay estimate of', '$', '161/year for a service that decreases emissions by 50%. Interpreting this estimate in another way it implies that the', '"', 'rm would need to reduce emissions by more than 40% to support a single cent per kWh premium (see Table 3 for a schedule translates willingness-to-pay estimates to price that premiums).', 'Median willingness to pay across all population seg- ments for a single percent decrease in air emissions ranges from', '$', '0.38 to', '$', '5.66 per year with lower values from respondents without a high school diploma and those with no environmental organization a', '$', 'liations.

Summary and conclusions', 'The paper presents two analyses of US consumers', "'", 'willingness to pay for environmental attributes of de- regulated electricity services: one based on consumer- based conjoint survey methods and one based upon hedonic analysis of price premiums charged in several deregulated US markets.', 'The survey results suggest that a wide array of popula- tion segments are willing to pay small amounts for tan- gible improvements in air emissions even if no alteration of power generation sources take place. These same re- sults suggest that for certain population segments only larger premiums may be obtained for emissions reduc- tions that are accompany by increased reliance upon renewable fuels. Some willingness to pay for emissions reductions via increased reliance on nuclear power was also found though this was generally limited to indi- viduals in the Southeast and to those with more formal education but no a', '$', 'liations with environmental organ- izations.', 'Analysis of US green electricity o', '!', 'erings suggests that a wide array of product features explain the price pre- miums charged. The percent of power supplied by newly created renewable generation capacity is one key deter- minate; a 1% increase in such sources increases the premium for a household using 1000 kWh per month by about', '$', '6 per annum. Certi', '"', 'cation brand name and state of o', '!', 'er also help explain the premium structure. The', 'magnitude of the estimated environmental premiums are similar to those found in the survey analysis if survey respondents attributed di', '!', 'erences in hypothetical servi- ces', "'", 'renewable generation capacity to di', '!', 'erences in newly created renewable generation capacity. If instead survey respondents attribute increases in total renewable sour- ces chie', '#', 'y to increased reliance upon existing renewable sources the survey results solidly overstate predicted price premiums available for newly created generation capacity.', 'The wide spread appeal of emissions reduction without fuel mix alteration in the survey results suggests that', '"', 'rms may not need to enter the realm of renewable generation sources to garner a price premium so long as they can communicate their improved emissions record. However in the states with active residential electricity markets featuring green alternatives used in the hedonic', 'analysis the standardized environmental communica-', 'tion vehicles currently focus on fuel mix only.
