1. Introduction 


Climate  change  is  expected  to  significantly  impact  East  African 
ecosystems in the coming years, including biodiversity and provisioning 
services in regions such as the Lake Victoria basin (Chapman et al., 2008; 
Lejju, 2012). The frequency and intensity of rainfall is expected to in-
crease,  and  temperature  is  predicted  to  rise  (Luhunga  and  Songoro, 
2020), both of which will consequently impact commercial activities, 
agriculture, water stress, health, and food security in the region (IPCC, 
2022). The climate of the East African region is complex due to the in-
fluence of the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean (Liu et al., 2017; Marchant 
et al., 2007; Nicholson and Kim, 1997). Changes in temperature, rainfall, 
fire  regime,  herbivory  and  human  activities  are  among  the  most 
important factors altering the landscape. Some of these environmental 
drivers have been studied in the Lake Victoria basin since the beginning 
of  the  20th  century,  with  a  special  focus  on  the  geological  history 
(Wayland, 1929), the lake’s water level fluctuations following the late 
Pleistocene  desiccation  (Johnson  et  al.,  1996;  Kendall,  1969;  Stager, 
1984;  Stager  et  al.,  2011;  Stager  and  Johnson,  2008;  Talbot  and  Liv-
ingstone,  1989;  Wienhues  et  al.,  2023),  and  vegetation  dynamics 
revealing  important  changes  since  the  Pleistocene  to  modern  times 
(Beuning, 1999a; Colombaroli et al., 2014; Kendall, 1969; Ssemmanda 
and Vincens, 2002, 2018; Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023).

and Vincens, 2002, 2018; Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023). 


Lake Victoria is the largest tropical lake on Earth; thus, both aquatic 
and  terrestrial  habitats  in  its  basin  represent  important  reservoirs  of 
biodiversity  (Sayer  et  al.,  2018;  UN-Habitat,  2008).  One  of  the  most 
significant  impacts  for  the  vegetation  on  both  historical  and  palae-
oenvironmental  (Late Quaternary)  scales  has  been  the  change  in pre-
cipitation regimes, which results in variable drought frequency, changes 
in  lake  water  level  and  changes to  the  surrounding  vegetation (Nich-
olson and Yin, 2001).

In the past 17,000 years, rainfall and temperature have played an 
important role in shaping the landscape. In this context, palynological 
records from Lake Victoria have allowed us to examine general trends in 
vegetation dynamics and reported considerable biome changes (Kendall, 
1969; Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023). Namely, the expansion of Afro-
montane vegetation at ca. 13,250 cal yr BP, the expansion of the tropical 
rainforest at ca. 10,600 cal yr BP, and the re-expansion of the savanna 
after 4500 cal yr BP (Kendall, 1969; Temoltzin-Loranca et  al., 2023). 
While these major biome shifts have been documented in past studies, 
the temporal resolution of available records remained rather low (for 
instance,  every  ca.  340  years  in  Kendall,  1969  or  ca.  410  years  in 
Beuning, 1999a and ca. 700 years in Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023), 
which impeded to thoroughly address the involved ecological processes 
such as the ecosystem responses to climate change during the savanna- 
rainforest transition and the fire regimes in the Lake Victoria area.

The  timespan  analysed  here  covers  some  major  climate  and 
ecosystem  reorganizations during  the latest Pleistocene and  the Early 
Holocene, including the onset of the African Humid Period (AHP) – the 
most notable climatic period for the African continent since the Pleis-
tocene to modern times – which extends from ca. 14,800 to 5500 cal yr 
BP (deMenocal et al., 2000; Shanahan et al., 2015). More specifically, 
humidity  peaked  during  the  Early  and  Mid-Holocene,  triggering 
important vegetation changes, such as the decline of savanna and the 
expansion of forests in East Africa (Ssemmanda and Vincens, 1993; Van 
Zinderen Bakker and Coetzee, 1988; Vincens et al., 2005). Considering 
the importance of such ecological reorganizations, in this manuscript we 
refer  to  this humid-warm period at  ca. 11,500–5500  cal yr  BP  as the 
Holocene AHP.

The  major  biome  reorganizations  observed  in  previous  palae-
oecological investigations opened major questions regarding the precise 
timing of changes and the ecological processes involved. For instance, 
the timing of the spread of the tropical rainforest dominated by Mor-
aceae in the surroundings of Lake Victoria was debated, mainly due to 
differences  in  the  accuracy  of  the  chronologies  previously  published. 
While  Kendall  (1969)  reported  the  expansion  at  ca.  9500  14C  yr  BP

C  yr  BP 


(10,900 cal yr BP) during the Holocene AHP, Beuning (1999a) suggested 
it occurred in the Late Pleistocene at ca. 11,200 14C yr BP (13,100 cal yr 
BP). Three independently dated pollen records collected from sediment 
cores along a transect from the lake shore to the deep water presented in 
Temoltzin-Loranca  et  al.  (2023)  provided  robust  evidence  that  the 
tropical rainforest spread between 11,500 and 10,000 cal yr BP, con-
firming the Early Holocene age of this important vegetation reorgani-
zation.  However,  the  low  temporal  resolution  of  that  study  (ca.  700 
years  on  average  in  sediment  cores  LV1,  LV2  and  LV4)  impeded  a 
chronologically  and  ecologically  precise  assessment.  For  instance,  it 
remains unclear whether the tropical rainforest spread solely in response 
to moisture conditions, or if the Early Holocene warming also played a 
role.  Similarly,  the  ecological  processes  that  led  to  the  expansion  of 
Afromontane  vegetation  at  ca.  13,250  cal  yr  BP  are  elusive,  and  the 
source  of  fire  remained  unexplored  (Temoltzin-Loranca  et  al.,  2023). 
Here, we aim to merge this gap by investigating the changes observed 
during the savanna-forest transition from the latest Pleistocene (16,600 
cal yr BP) to the Early Holocene (9000 cal yr BP) at a high temporal 
resolution (every 40 years).

This study seeks to: (I) provide the first high–resolution pollen record 
for the Lake Victoria basin during the latest Pleistocene and Early Ho-
locene;  (II)  to  assess  the  major  vegetation  and  ecosystem  changes 
including the source of the biomass burning; and (III) to elucidate the 
ecosystem responses to climate, by comparing our palaeoecological time 
series  with  independent  palaeoclimate  proxies,  reflecting  rainfall 
amount  and  temperature  (Berke  et  al.,  2012).  We  are  particularly 
interested  in  the  factors  that  allowed  Afromontane  and  tropical  rain-
forest  vegetation  to  gradually  replace  the  savanna  during  the  period 
from 16,600 to 9000 cal yr BP.

Lake  Victoria  is  the  second-largest  freshwater  lake  in  the  world 
(surface  area  = 68,800  km2).  Its  formation  can  be  attributed  to  the 
reverse  flow resulting  from the  damming  of  rivers  flowing  westward, 
brought about by the uplifting of the western section of the East African 
Rift System (EARS; Danley et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2000). Since its 
formation, the lake has undergone alterations over time, but there is no 
evidence of further tectonic modifications since the middle Pleistocene 
(Beverly et al., 2020). It is located at an altitude of 1135 m above sea 
level (m asl), and it has a maximum water depth of 68 m (Johnson et al., 
1996;  Fig.  1a).  Rainfall  is  the  biggest  contributor  to  Lake  Victoria’s 
water balance accounting for ca. 80%, and the remaining ca. 20% comes 
from 17  tributaries of which  the  largest  is the  Kagera River  (Yin and 
Nicholson, 1998). Both rainfall and the wind regime follow a bimodal 
pattern with two rainy seasons occurring from March to June, and from 
October  to  December  (Okungu  et  al.,  2005).  Today’s  precipitation 
ranges from 1000 to 1500 mm/year, mainly controlled by the migration 
of the Afrotropical rainbelt and the Congo Air Boundary (CAB) across 
the  equator  (Colombaroli  et  al.,  2018;  Okungu  et  al.,  2005;  Tierney 
et al., 2011; Verschuren et al., 2009). The wind direction from January 
to March is regulated by the Northeast Monsoon, whereas from August 
to  September  it  is  influenced  by  the  Southeast  Monsoon  (Nieuwolt, 
1979). The times between April and July, and October and December 
are transitional periods (Okungu et al., 2005).

The three main biomes or vegetation types around Lake Victoria are 
the tropical rainforests (Elenga et al., 2000; Vincens et al., 2006) that 
develop  in  warm-humid  conditions,  the  Afromontane  forests  which 
expand at higher and cooler altitudes at ca. 1200–2500 m asl, and the 
tropical savanna, rich in evergreen to semi–evergreen bushlands, which 
extend over warm to arid conditions (Lillesø et al., 2011; Fig. 1b). More 
specifically,  the  vegetation  types  include  the  Guineo–Congolian  rain-

(White,  1983),  as  well  as  several  transitional  plant  communities  be-

the pollen evidence, we have grouped all the rainforest types under the 
African biome “tropical rainforest” (e.g. Elenga et al., 2000), and the two 
types  of  Afromontane  forests  under  Afromontane  vegetation  (FTEA, 
1995–2012). In addition to the zonal vegetation types, azonal vegetation 
can occur in areas such as wetlands (FTEA, 1952–2012). Today, the lake 
basin  is  surrounded  by  the  ecosystems  mentioned  above,  having  the 
closest stands of Afromontane taxa at Mount Elgon (ca. 90 km), the Mau 
escarpment (ca. 180 km), and the Ngorongoro crater (200 km; Hedberg, 
1955). Outside the study region, subtropical to temperate Afromontane 
forests grow in disjunct zones of the mountains of East, West and South 
Africa (Allen et al., 2021; Bekele, 1993; Mucina and Geldenhuys, 2016; 
Powell  et  al.,  2023).  Striking  floristic  (e.g.  Olea,  Podocarpus,  Celtis, 
Juniperus,  Erica)  and  faunal  similarities,  as  well  as  ecological  niche 
models, suggest that these isolated mountain forest communities were 
connected in the past during cold periods of the Pleistocene that allowed 
Afromontane taxa to spread to lower altitudes (Allen et al., 2021).

depth  models  coming  from  two  other  coring  sites  at  Lake  Victoria 
(LV1 and LV2). Details of these complex chronologies are provided in 
Temoltzin-Loranca et al. (2023). Scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was 
performed at 5 mm intervals with an ITRAX core scanner using a Mo- 
and Cr- anode X-ray tube at 50 mA, 30 kV and 30 s integration time. 
Here,  we  display  only  2  elemental  ratios,  Rb/K  as  an  indicator  of 
chemical weathering (Wienhues et al., 2023) and Zr/Ti as a grain size 
proxy (e.g. Brown et al., 2007). Rb/Zr typically increases when chemical 
weathering is high, whereas Zr/Ti shows higher values with an increase 
in grain size (Davies et al., 2015).

2.3. Pollen and charcoal analyses 


We took 153 sediment samples of 1 cm3 which were collected at 2 cm 
intervals (ca. every 40 years) throughout the lower portion of LV4 (core 
depths = 463–777 cm). The samples were prepared for pollen analyses 
following  standard  procedures  using  HCl,  KOH,  HF  and  acetolysis 
(Moore et al., 1991). Lycopodium clavatum tablets (Batch number 3862 
with n = 9666 ± 671 spores per tablet) provided by the University of 
Lund  (Maher,  1981)  were  added  to  the  samples  prior  to  chemical 
treatment  in  order  to  calculate  microfossil  concentrations  and  influx 
(Stockmarr, 1971). Samples were stained with fuchsine and diluted with 
glycerine for mounting. The slides were analysed under a light micro-
scope (Leica 2500) at 400× magnification. We used palynological keys, 
atlases (Gosling et al., 2013; Reille, 1992; Roubik and Moreno, 1991; 
Schüler  and  Hemp,  2016)  and  the  pollen  reference  collection  of  the

University of G¨ottingen, Germany. Pollen sums ranged from 98 (deepest 
sample of the record where grains were rare to find) to 588 grains per 
sample  (mean  = 375  pollen  grains,  standard  deviation  = 95).  Pollen 
percentages were calculated with respect to the terrestrial pollen sum 
excluding pollen of aquatic and wetland plants and spores. Eight sam-
ples above the lowermost sample were palynologically sterile (ca. 300 
years). 
For biomass burning assessment, we analysed macrocharcoal for a 
total of 389 sediment samples (whole core) of ca. 9 cm3  taken contin-
uously at 2 cm intervals and sieved through a mesh size of 200 μm (see 
Temoltzin-Loranca  et  al.,  2023).  In  this  paper  we  only  display  the 
samples corresponding to the lower portion of LV4 (depths = 463–777). 
The samples were analysed under a stereomicroscope (Leica M125) at 
40× magnification, and the charcoal was picked. Additionally, charcoal 
morphotypes (wood vs grass) were determined following Colombaroli 
et al.’s (2014) approach. Charcoal particles with a length–width ratio ≥
3:1 and stomata within the rows of epidermal cells (Colombaroli et al., 
2014;  Jensen  et  al.,  2007)  were  considered  to  originate  from  grass, 
whereas  particles  with  thicker  structure  and  a  length–width  ratio  of 
≤3:1  were  identified  as  wood  charcoal  pieces  (Umbanhowar  and 
Mcgrath,  1998).  For  the  calculation  of  macroscopic  charcoal  influx, 
charcoal particle numbers were standardized to 1 cm3 respectively to 1 
cm2/year  using  the  age-depth  model  from  Temoltzin-Loranca  et  al. 
(2023). 
2.4. Numerical methods 
2.4.1. Pollen zonation and ordination 
We  assigned  Local  Pollen  Assemblage  Zones  (LPAZ)  by  using  the 
optimal partitioning approach with a minimum sum of squares (Birks 
and Gordon, 1985) and determined the number of significant zones with 
the aid of the broken-stick model (Bennett, 1996). In order to retain the 
original low-resolution subdivision (LPAZ) of Temoltzin-Loranca et al. 
(2023),  the  new  significant  zone  limits,  resulting  from  the  additional 
pollen sample analysis, were used to delimit subzones. 
To  identify  gradients  in  vegetation  composition,  we  analysed  the 
pollen  percentage  data  with  a  Detrended  Correspondence  Analysis 
ˇ
(DCA; Legendre and Birks, 2012; Lepˇs and 
Smilauer, 2003; ter Braak and 
ˇ
Prentice, 1988) using Canoco 5.10 (ter Braak and 
Smilauer, 2018). The 
gradient length of the first axis of the DCA was 1.71 standard deviations, 
indicating that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) would be suitable 
to analyse the data. Since the PCA displayed a marked horseshoe effect, 
we  used  a  detrended  unimodal  ordination  technique  (i.e.  DCA)  to 
eliminate the horseshoe effect (Legendre and Birks, 2012; ter Braak and 
Prentice, 1988). Pollen percentage data was detrended by segments, and 
we  applied  a  squared-root  transformation  to  stabilize  the  variance. 
Additionally, the rare types were down-weighted using the automated 
down-weight function in CANOCO 5.10 in order to reduce their influ-
ence and to emphasize the importance of dominant types. This down-
weighting gives low weight to rare species during the calculation of the 
ˇ
Smilauer, 2018). Therefore, only the 35 taxa 
ordination (ter Braak and 
with the largest contribution to the total variance explained along axis 1 
and 2 are shown in the final figure. 
2.4.2. Response curves 
In order to explore the response of selected taxa to climate, specif-
ically rainfall and temperature, we fitted generalized additive models 
ˇ
Smilauer and Lepˇs, 2014) assuming 
GAMs (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990; 
a  Poisson  distribution  for  the  response  variables  and  using  a  log  link 
function with a maximum of 2 degrees of freedom (DF). Then, we chose 
the  most  parsimonious  model  using  stepwise  selection  based  on  the 
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. Response curves were fitted in 
ˇ
Canoco  5  (ter  Braak  and 
Smilauer,  2018).  In  this  study  we  used  the 
previously published data from TEX86, and δD leaf wax (Berke et al., 2012) 
to  represent  past  changes  in  temperature  and  rainfall  amount  in  the 
study region. Additionally, we tested the response of vegetation to fire 
(charcoal); however, as the response curves did not exhibit noteworthy 
responses, we decided to not pursue further analysis. 
3. Results and interpretation 
3.1. Vegetation and fire history 
The palaeoecological record of Lake Victoria (LV4) starts at 16,600 
cal  yr  BP  and  the  whole  examined  sequence  includes  7600  years 
(16,600–9000 cal yr BP; Figs. 2 and 3). However, in the bottom part of 
the core, pollen grains were very rare or absent from 16,600 to 16,300 
cal yr BP. We found a total of 128 pollen taxa that were identified to the 
most  detailed  taxonomic  level  possible.  Due  to  the  higher  temporal 
resolution of this record, the subzones LV4-1a and LV4-1b previously 
determined by visual criteria (Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023) were now 
statistically  significant.  Moreover,  LV4–2  resulted  in  two  additional 
statistically significant subzones: LV4–2a and LV4–2b. 
LV4-1a  (16,600–13,250  cal  yr  BP);  dominance  of  the  savanna 
grasslands. Herbaceous pollen is present in the landscape with values 
close to 90% of abundance. The most frequent taxa are Poaceae, which 
maintains pollen values between 50% and 60%, as well as Cyperaceae, 
with values around 10 to 20%. Pollen belonging to the Amaranthaceae, 
Brassicaceae and Cichorioideae families and taxa such as Artemisia and 
Senecio are also important (5–10%). Additionally, our pollen data sug-
gest  the  presence  of  savanna  trees  such  as  Acacia-type,  Combretum, 
Indigofera  and  Lannea  (Figs.  2  and  3).  The  pollen assemblage  also  in-
dicates  the  presence  of  sparse  Afromontane  vegetation  which,  under 
cooler conditions (Berke et al., 2012) might have formed isolated stands 
in the surroundings of the lake (e.g. trees and shrubs such as Podocarpus, 
Celtis, Olea, and Juniperus, as well as herbs such as Conyza, and Rumex; 
Fig. 4). Olea expanded for the first time around 15,000 cal yr BP but 
remained rather low until ca. 13,800 cal yr BP. During this period, the 
lake was most likely shallow, the presence of Typha (>3%) suggests the 
proximity of our coring spot (today at 63 m water depth) to a lake shore 
or  wetland,  until  ca.  13,800  cal  yr  BP,  when  aquatic  taxa  (Lemna, 
Potamogeton, Nymphaea coerulea, Nymphaea lotus) disapeared. 
Frequent biomass burning inferred from macrocharcoal influx peaks 
occurred  between  16,600  and  16,000  cal  yr  BP.  The  higher  influx  in 
woody charcoal particles suggests that most fires occurred in the (pol-
len-inferred) Afromontane stands (Olea, Podocarpus, Juniperus). Around 
15,500 cal yr BP, grassland burning started to increase steadily, result-
ing in maximum values in the grass charcoal influx around 14,500 cal yr 
BP (Fig. 3). Towards the end of this zone (around 14,000 cal yr BP), the 
amount of savanna fires as inferred from grassland charcoal declined to 
become low (when compared to previous times). 
LV4-1b  (13,250–10,700  cal  yr  BP);  spread  of  Afromontane 
vegetation, first tropical rainforest or gallery forest stands. Pollen of 
herbs continues to dominate the record (Fig. 4); however, it decreases to 
ca. 65%. Pollen of woody taxa characteristic of the thicket clumps, such 
as Allophylus, Trema, Scutia, Grewia and Syzygium increases (Figs. 2 and 
3).  Subtropical  Afromontane  vegetation  spread  rather  abruptly  at 
around  13,250  cal  yr  BP.  Specifically,  pollen  from  Olea  becomes 
important (>15%) together with Podocarpus, Celtis and Macaranga (ca. 
5%). Moreover, concurrent with the mass expansion of Olea, an initial 
establishment of tropical rainforest or gallery forest taxa occurred. At 
around 11,500–11,100 cal yr BP the tropical rainforest taxon Moraceae 
increased  to  reach  a  first  peak  (>10%),  while  moderate  minima  of 
Moraceae occurred around 12,500, 11,700 and 10,800 cal yr BP. From 
ca.  11,100  to  10,700  cal  yr  BP,  higher  macroscopic  charcoal  influx 
dominated  by  woody  taxa  suggests  frequent  fire  events  in  the  Afro-
montane and rainforest stands. 
LV4–2a  (10,700–10,300  cal  yr  BP),  expansion  of  the  tropical 
rainforest and the vanishing of the savanna. Pollen percentages of 
herbs (particularly Poaceae and Cyperaceae) decrease markedly (Figs. 2 
and 3), while arboreal pollen percentages increase (>60%). Pollen of 
tropical rainforest taxa such Moraceae (>20%), Alchornea (ca. 5%) and

The palaeoecological record of Lake Victoria (LV4) starts at 16,600

resolution of this record, the subzones LV4-1a and LV4-1b previously 
determined by visual criteria (Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023) were now 
statistically  significant.  Moreover,  LV4–2  resulted  in  two  additional 
statistically significant subzones: LV4–2a and LV4–2b. 

The palaeoecological record of Lake Victoria (LV4) starts at 16,600 
cal  yr  BP  and  the  whole  examined  sequence  includes  7600  years 
(16,600


–
9000 cal yr BP; Figs. 2 and 3). However, in the bottom part of 
the core, pollen grains were very rare or absent from 16,600 to 16,300 
cal yr BP. We found a total of 128 pollen taxa that were identified to the 
most  detailed  taxonomic  level  possible.  Due  to  the  higher  temporal 
resolution of this record, the subzones LV4-1a and LV4-1b previously 
determined by visual criteria (Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023) were now 
statistically  significant.  Moreover,  LV4

LV4-1a  (16,600–13,250  cal  yr  BP);  dominance  of  the  savanna 
grasslands. Herbaceous pollen is present in the landscape with values 
close to 90% of abundance. The most frequent taxa are Poaceae, which 
maintains pollen values between 50% and 60%, as well as Cyperaceae, 
with values around 10 to 20%. Pollen belonging to the Amaranthaceae, 
Brassicaceae and Cichorioideae families and taxa such as Artemisia and 
Senecio are also important (5–10%). Additionally, our pollen data sug-
gest  the  presence  of  savanna  trees  such  as  Acacia-type,  Combretum, 
Indigofera  and  Lannea  (Figs.  2  and  3).  The  pollen assemblage  also  in-
dicates  the  presence  of  sparse  Afromontane  vegetation  which,  under 
cooler conditions (Berke et al., 2012) might have formed isolated stands 
in the surroundings of the lake (e.g. trees and shrubs such as Podocarpus, 
Celtis, Olea, and Juniperus, as well as herbs such as Conyza, and Rumex; 
Fig. 4). Olea expanded for the first time around 15,000 cal yr BP but 
remained rather low until ca. 13,800 cal yr BP. During this period, the 
lake was most likely shallow, the presence of Typha (>3%) suggests the 
proximity of our coring spot (today at 63 m water depth) to a lake shore 
or  wetland,  until  ca.  13,800  cal  yr  BP,  when  aquatic  taxa  (Lemna, 
Potamogeton, Nymphaea coerulea, Nymphaea lotus) disapeared.

Frequent biomass burning inferred from macrocharcoal influx peaks 
occurred  between  16,600  and  16,000  cal  yr  BP.  The  higher  influx  in 
woody charcoal particles suggests that most fires occurred in the (pol-
len-inferred) Afromontane stands (Olea, Podocarpus, Juniperus). Around 
15,500 cal yr BP, grassland burning started to increase steadily, result-
ing in maximum values in the grass charcoal influx around 14,500 cal yr 
BP (Fig. 3). Towards the end of this zone (around 14,000 cal yr BP), the 
amount of savanna fires as inferred from grassland charcoal declined to 
become low (when compared to previous times).

LV4-1b  (13,250–10,700  cal  yr  BP);  spread  of  Afromontane 
vegetation, first tropical rainforest or gallery forest stands. Pollen of 
herbs continues to dominate the record (Fig. 4); however, it decreases to 
ca. 65%. Pollen of woody taxa characteristic of the thicket clumps, such 
as Allophylus, Trema, Scutia, Grewia and Syzygium increases (Figs. 2 and 
3).  Subtropical  Afromontane  vegetation  spread  rather  abruptly  at 
around  13,250  cal  yr  BP.  Specifically,  pollen  from  Olea  becomes 
important (>15%) together with Podocarpus, Celtis and Macaranga (ca. 
5%). Moreover, concurrent with the mass expansion of Olea, an initial 
establishment of tropical rainforest or gallery forest taxa occurred. At 
around 11,500–11,100 cal yr BP the tropical rainforest taxon Moraceae 
increased  to  reach  a  first  peak  (>10%),  while  moderate  minima  of 
Moraceae occurred around 12,500, 11,700 and 10,800 cal yr BP. From 
ca.  11,100  to  10,700  cal  yr  BP,  higher  macroscopic  charcoal  influx 
dominated  by  woody  taxa  suggests  frequent  fire  events  in  the  Afro-
montane and rainforest stands.

(sea green) and Afromontane (olive green). Wetland and aquatics are represented in blue. LPAZ = Local pollen assemblage zones. Empty curves represent a 10×

imposed on the charcoal data indicate LOWESS smoothing used only for visualization purposes. The gray curve represents the total charcoal influx. Temperature

record of Lake Victoria is plotted in

Acalypha (2%) spread around Lake Victoria during this period. Changes 
in the Afromontane forests comprised the expansion of Olea, Celtis and 
Macaranga, while Podocarpus remained rare and others such as Myrica, 
Juniperus,  Ericaceae  and  Hagenia  decreased  markedly.  A  remarkable 
change  in  savanna  trees  and  shrub  communities  and  thicket  clumps 
occurred during LV4–2a (Fig. 4), with a shift from Combretum to Trema, 
likely indicating the expansion of evergreen Trema trees on the costs of 
drought-adapted Combretum shrublands. Subtropical and tropical trees 
or shrubs such as Phoenix-type and Alchornea spread during this phase 
with distinct pollen peaks at around 10,300 cal yr BP at the transition to 
zone  LV4–2b.  Interestingly,  Tetrorchidium  appeared  for  the  first  time 
together  with  Musanga  in  the  pollen  record,  likely  pointing  to  the 
persistence of canopy openings in a disturbed environment. At the onset 
of  this  subzone  around  10,700  cal  yr  BP  macroscopic  charcoal  origi-
nating from trees starts to decline after a last peak, suggesting that forest 
fires became less frequent than before. 
LV4–2b  (10,300–9000  cal  yr  BP),  further  spread  of  tropical 
rainforests  and  persistence  of  Afromontane  vegetation.  At  ca. 
10,300 cal yr BP the dominance of Moraceae pollen rapidly increases 
from 30 to 40% suggesting that tropical rainforests spread abruptly (in 
<40 years; Figs. 2, 3 and 5f). Around 10,000 cal yr BP Moraceae was 
partly replaced over 100–200 years by tropical rainforest taxa such as 
Alchornea (ca. 5%) and Acalypha (ca. 3%). Furthermore, pollen taxa such 
as Phoenix-type and Tetrorchidium are lacking during this phase, indi-
cating a decline of these palms, shrubs or trees in the lake catchment. 
Fluctuations among the tropical rainforest tree taxa may indicate minor 
reorganizations  of  vegetation  composition  and  successional  processes 
towards closed forest canopy. Indeed, after 10,000 cal yr BP, arboreal 
pollen (AP) dominated by Moraceae, reaches peak values around 75%, 
suggesting  the  occurrence  of  rather  dense  forest  in  the  Lake  Victoria 
area.  Although  declining,  the  pioneer  tree  Musanga  persisted,  while 
Urera-type,  possibly  in  the  form  of  lianas  reaching  the  forest  canopy, 
spread. The expansion of tropical rainforest was not at the expense of 
Afromontane taxa with stable populations of Olea (pollen ca.10%) and 
Macaranga  (pollen  ca.  5%),  but  rather  the  savanna  vegetation  almost 
collapsed. Specifically, pollen of herbaceous taxa such as Poaceae (ca.

20%),  Cyperaceae,  Artemisia  (ca.  2%),  as  well  as  pollen  of  savanna 
woody  taxa  such  as  Combretum  and  Indigofera  reached  lower  abun-
dances.  Macroscopic  herbaceous  and  woody  charcoal  influx  suggests 
fewer fires when compared to previous zones. 
3.2. Ordination and response curves 
The ordination results are displayed in a taxa and sample scatterplot 
(Fig. 6a and b), and as variations in DCA axis 1 over time (Fig. 5b). The 
taxa scores indicate that DCA axis 1, explaining 21.07% of the variance 
in the taxa data, represents a gradient of temperature and moisture re-
quirements from warm and wet (e.g. Moraceae, Acalypha, Urera-type) to 
cool and dry (e.g. Amaranthaceae, Rumex, Acacia-type, Indigofera). For 
DCA axis 2, explaining only 4.04% of the variance, taxa scores suggest a 
weak gradient from eroding habitats (e.g. Thalictrum, Hypericum, Lan-
nea,  Euphorbia)  to  more  stable  landscapes  (e.g.  Asteroideae,  Lemna, 
Acacia-type). In the sample scatterplot, the sample scores are grouped 
according to the statistically significant pollen assemblage zones LV4-1a 
to LV4–2b. When plotting variations in DCA axis 1 along time, together 
with changes in temperature, rainfall amount, and proxy measurements 
for chemical weathering (Rb/K; Wienhues et al., 2023) and grain size 
(Zr/Ti; Fig. 5a), axis 1 scores follow changes in climatic conditions from 
cool and dry to warm and wet. Until ca. 10,700 cal yr BP, before the 
tropical rainforest dominated by Moraceae became prevalent, cool and 
dry conditions were associated with low or shallow erosion, while warm 
and  wet  conditions  were  associated  with  enhanced  or  more  deeply 
incised erosion (Fig. 5). With the mass expansion of the tropical rain-
forest, the erosion declined. 
Although the response curves based on fossil pollen occurrences and 
palaeoclimatic data (GAMs; Figs. 7, S1, S2) cannot capture the full cli-
matic niches of the taxa, they reveal interesting linkages to climate and 
moisture.  Afromontane  taxa  such  as  Podocarpus,  Macaranga  and  Olea

◦
were advantaged by warm conditions and responded positively to high 
moisture  availability.  The  tropical  rainforest  and  riverine  forest  taxa 
(Moraceae  and  Urera-type)  responded  similarly.  In  contrast,  Afro-
montane Juniperus was favoured by drier and cooler conditions, similar 
to savanna taxa such as Poaceae and Amaranthaceae. Moraceae and Olea 
responded most positively to warming, while grasses (Poaceae, Cyper-
aceae)  benefitted  mostly  from  cool  conditions.  In  contrast  to  the 
generally  positive  response  to  temperature,  Moraceae  and  Olea  were 
advantaged by moister conditions only until a certain level, after which 
they  started  to  decline.  Poaceae  and  Amaranthaceae  were  strongly 
advantaged by drier conditions. 
4. Discussion 
4.1. Causes of vegetation dynamics in the latest Pleistocene 
During the latest Pleistocene at around ca. 19,000 cal yr BP (Hughes 
et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2023), dry and cool conditions prevailed across 
East  Africa  over  a  range  of  elevations,  from  the  summit  of  Mt.  Kili-
manjaro (Schüler et al., 2012) to intermediate and low altitudes such as 
at  Lake  Albert  (Berke  et  al.,  2014),  Lake  Tanganyika  (Vincens  et  al., 
1993) and Lake Victoria (Berke et al., 2012). The southward shift of the 
◦
Afrotropical rainbelt and reorganization of the monsoon circulation, in 
combination with a weakening of regional rainfall systems at ca. 17,000 
cal yr BP, altered the climate at lower elevation sites causing aridity, 
which played an important role in Tanzania, Ghana, the Niger-Sanaga 
and Congo watersheds (Stager et al., 2011). At this time, Lake Victoria 
was experiencing a desiccation phase, as evidenced by seismic data and 
the presence of a palaeo-vertisol (Beverly et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 
1996; Stager et al., 2011). In the surrounding region, grassland savanna 
became  the  dominant  landscape  feature,  alongside  the  coexistence  of 
Afromontane vegetation, until temperatures started to gradually rise by 
ca. 2 
C before 15,500 cal yr BP in eastern Africa (Berke et al., 2012; 
Figs. 7 and S2). Warming associated with the end of Heinrich event 1, at 
around 16,000 has been also documented in other regions such as the 
Mediterranean realm (Samartin et al., 2012) and in Europe north of the 
Alps (Bolland et al., 2020). In our study area, this shift in temperature 
induced ecosystem changes including increased grassland-savanna fire 
activity at around 16,000–15,500 cal yr BP (Figs. 3, 5d, S2). In agree-
ment with our evidence (pollen, grassy charcoal), Polycyclic Aromatic 
Hydrocarbons  (PAH)  show  that  biomass  burning  at  this  time  was 
dominated by angiosperms in the Lake Victoria area (Karp et al., 2023). 
It  is  likely  that  during  this  time,  Conyza  benefited  from  increased 
burning  because  of  its  resistance  to  disturbance  (Schüler  and  Hemp,

Fig. 6. (A) Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) scatterplots of taxa, and (B) samples scores. In (A) the scatter of taxa scores along DCA Axis 1 (21.07% of 
variance)  indicates  a  gradient  of  temperature  and  moisture,  with  taxa  associated  with  lower  lake  levels,  dry  and  cold  environments  (e.g.  Typha,  Lemna,  Amar-
anthaceae, Asteroideae) with high scores and those associated with warm, moist, and forested environments (e.g. Moraceae, Macaranga, Alchornea) with low scores: 
Taxa scores along axis 2 (4.04% of variance) suggest a weak gradient between eroding habitats (e.g. Thalictrum, Hypericum, Lannea, Euphorbia, low scores) and more 
stable landscapes (e.g. Asteroideae, Lemna, Acacia-type, high scores). The shaded area represents the main different biomes: Aquatic (light blue), Savanna (light 
brown), Afromontane (dark green), Tropical rainforest (light green). In (B) the samples are grouped according to the local pollen assemblage zones (LPAZ). (For

2016) and could, therefore, spread in the savanna (Figs. 2 and 3). 
At Lake Masoko, ca. 700 km south of Lake Victoria, an expansion of 
semi-deciduous forests took place between 16,000 and 14,000 cal yr BP 
(Vincens  et  al.,  2007)  when  precipitation  was  rather  high.  It  is 
conceivable that warmer and/or moister conditions caused the minor 
increase of Olea abundances at Lake Victoria around 15,000 cal yr BP 
(Figs.  3  and  5).  However,  in  addition  to  higher  temperatures  (Berke 
et al., 2012), precipitation regimes must have varied significantly given 
that  some  lakes  in  eastern  Africa  started  to  dry  out  approximately  at 
15,000 cal yr BP (L´ezine, 2007). Indeed, afforestation was interrupted 
ca. 200 km north-west of Lake Victoria at Lake Albert and further west in 
western Africa at Lake Bosumtwi (Bonnefille and Riollet, 1988) and herb 
taxa re-expanded in the surroundings of Lake Magadi ca. 250 km south- 
east of Lake Victoria (Elmoutaki, 1994). 
Afromontane Olea spread at ca. 13,250 cal. yr BP (Figs. 3 and 5f), 
while  drought-adapted  trees  and  shrubs  declined,  the  thicket  clumps 
expanded in the savanna. This vegetation shift likely promoted diverse 
microclimates within the savanna, which helped among others, to retain 
water. The expansion of Olea was followed by other Afromontane trees 
such as Podocarpus, Celtis and Macaranga, the latter preferring swamp 
forest habitats (Beuning, 1999a). Our results also show that the savanna 
herbs  contracted  slightly,  while  tropical  rainforest  taxa  such  as  Mor-
aceae,  Acalypha  and  Alchornea  benefitted,  probably  forming  fringing 
forests  due  to  the  return  to  more  humid  conditions,  as  suggested  by 
Tryon et al. (2016). Indeed, the lake levels of Lake Victoria rose between 
14,000  and  13,600  cal  yr  BP  (Wienhues  et  al.,  2023),  implying  that 
moisture availability increased. About 300 km south of Lake Victoria, 
the  Miombo  flora  diversified  around  Lake  Tanganyika,  promoting  di-
versity  in  the  savanna  with  more  moisture-loving  plants  (Vincens, 
1991). 
The  latest  Pleistocene  increase  of  Afromontane  pollen  has  led  to 
debates  about  long-distance  transport  (e.g.  Beuning,  1999a;  Kendall, 
1969; Ssemmanda and Vincens, 2018). At Lake Victoria the increase of 
Afromontane  pollen is recorded at all coring sites, and over  long dis-
tances  (e.g.  LV4  in  Temoltzin-Loranca  et  al.,  2023  vs.  P2  in  Kendall, 
1969, and V95–2P, in Beuning, 1999a). Therefore, it is likely that the 
expansion  of  Afromontane  vegetation  at  around  13,250  cal  yr  BP 
occurred throughout the entire Lake Victoria catchment. Moreover, we 
propose  that  due  to  cooler  conditions,  the  Afromontane  stands  were 
growing  at  lower  altitudes  and  closer  to  the  lake  shore  than  today 
(Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023). 
Between ca. 12,800–11,700 cal yr BP water tables dropped at several 
lakes in East Africa, suggesting arid conditions (Roberts et al., 1993). 
However, hydroclimatic reconstructions indicate that this was not the 
case at Lake Victoria (Casta˜neda et  al., 2016; Overpeck et al., 1996). 
Forest  cover  remained  comparable  to  the  preceding  period,  when 
arboreal pollen (AP) reached ca. 20–25%, while pollen influx slightly 
declined (Fig. 5e). At this time, our data point to minor expansions of 
tropical rainforest taxa (e.g., Moraceae, Alchornea), which occurred at 
the expenses of Afromontane Olea but not Podocarpus (Fig. 2). Such a 
vegetation response would require a minor warming and/or moisture 
increase, which is indeed recorded in the Lake Victoria palaeoclimatic 
proxies (Berke et al., 2012, see Figs. 3, 7, S1, S2). 
Increasing moisture during the latest Pleistocene prompted changes 
in aquatic plant communities (Figs. 2, S1). Kendall (1969) had already 
noticed an increase in Nymphaea at ca. 14,500 cal yr BP, interpreting it 
as  a change of water chemistry, probably in pH, resulting from more 
diluted  conditions.  This  finding  agrees  well  with  the  inference  of  a 
continuous water table rise at Lake Victoria (Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 
2023; Wienhues et al., 2023). Our new macrophyte pollen record refines 
this  notion  and  suggests  that  Nymphaea  caerulea  and  Nymphaea  lotus 
formed stands rather close to the coring site, together with other mac-
rophytes  such  as  Lemna  and  Potamogeton  during  the  period 
16,600–13,800  cal  yr  BP,  when  lake-levels  were  lower  than  today 
(Wienhues et al., 2023). Macrophyte populations may have grown next 
to the Typha reed belt, which is unambiguously documented by pollen 
percentages reaching 2–15% from 16,600–13,800 cal yr BP (Figs. 2 and 
3). After 13,800 cal yr BP aquatics completely disappeared locally and 
Typha  declined  massively  at  Lake  Victoria,  as  also  documented  by 
Beuning (1999b). 
In sum, during the period 16,600–11,500 cal yr BP, prior to the onset 
of the Holocene, the Lake Victoria basin was characterized by gradually 
increasing  temperatures  and  precipitation.  The  grassy  savanna  was 
converted into a woodland savanna, and subtropical or warm-temperate 
Afromontane taxa became more prominent at lower elevations together 
with  rare  first  gallery  or  tropical  rainforest  patches  (Fig.  4).  Fires 
occurred  regularly  throughout  the  period,  with  a  change  in  biomass 
burnt at around 13,800 cal yr BP, from a mostly grass-dominated fuel 
type during the earliest part of the period to a woody-dominated fuel 
type after this period. 
4.2. Biome reorganizations during the Holocene AHP 
Increases  in  temperatures  and  moisture  were  likely  caused  by  the 
strengthening of the East African Monsoon activity, towards the onset of 
the Holocene (Tierney et al., 2011). During the Holocene AHP, monsoon 
activity was higher across East Africa (Dallmeyer et al., 2020; Liu et al., 
2017), inducing more mesic conditions. Enhanced trade wind circula-
tion  and  moisture increase  led to two  sharp peaks of  pollen influx  in 
tropical Africa (L´ezine, 1998) as also observed in our record (Fig. 5e). At 
Lake Victoria, increases in temperature and precipitation caused a rapid 
transformation from savanna to tropical rainforest (Fig. 7), while Afro-
montane  vegetation  probably  moved  to  higher  altitudes  where  tem-
peratures were likely cooler (Kendall, 1969; Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 
2023). 
Previous studies in Lake Victoria discussed the timing of the spread 
of the tropical rainforest. For instance, in V95–2P (Beuning, 1999a), an 
initial phase was recognized in the Late Pleistocene (11,200 14C yr BP, 
ca. 13,100 cal yr BP), after which a discontinuity attributed to a hiatus in 
sedimentation  occurred,  preventing  any  more  detailed  assessment.  In 
this study we show that, after an initial spread at the earliest Holocene, 
the  main  tropical  rainforest  expansion  to  >20%  occurred  at  ca. 
10,700–10,500  cal  yr  BP  (Fig.  2).  This  finding  is  supported  by  three 
other  sedimentary  records  with  independent  chronologies:  LV1,  LV2; 
(Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023), and by the core P2 (Kendall, 1969), 
where the tropical rainforest expansion is dated at ca. 9500 14C yr BP, 
corresponding to 10,900 cal yr BP. 
The climatic change was more abrupt during the Early Holocene than 
during the latest Pleistocene, with precipitation increasing more rapidly 
than  temperature  at  ca.  11,500–10,700  cal  yr  BP.  (Figs.  3  and  5). 
Concurrently, a simultaneous rise in biomass burning accompanied the 
biome  reorganization.  Specifically,  at  ca.  11,700–11,100  cal  yr  BP 
Moraceae increased from ca. 3–5% (at the end of the Younger Dryas), to 
ca. 5–10% during the Early Holocene. The first Moraceae peak of >10% 
occurred  at ca. 11,200 cal yr BP, when precipitation  peaked (Fig. 5). 
When Moraceae expanded more massively at ca. 10,700 cal yr BP, the 
Afromontane  vegetation  spread  as  well.  This  spread  of  the  tropical 
rainforest and Afromontane plants is congruent with similar dynamics at 
other sites in the region, displaying expansions of Afromontane (mainly 
Olea), and pioneer forest taxa (Alchornea, Macaranga; L´ezine, 2007). At 
Lake  Victoria,  increased  rainfall  promoted  the  establishment  of  gap 
colonizer trees such as Tetrorchidium and Musanga. While the former is 
well adapted to moist conditions in the understories, the latter is well 
known for adapting in nutrient-poor or disturbed areas (Akinnifesi et al., 
2010; De Caluw´e and De Smedt, 2005; Vincens, 1991). Kendall (1969) 
suspected  a  misidentification  of  Musanga  pollen,  causing  a  spurious 
peak; in our record, we observe the same increase at the same time, so 
we can infer that its expansion, together with that of Urera-type, was 
real. It is plausible that this marked the initial stage of forest densifi-
cation, with some canopy openings, as observed in Gabon in more recent 
times  (Ngomanda  et  al.,  2005).  Consequently,  the  incidence  of  fires 
likely declined between 10,500 and 9700 cal yr BP.

Later at ca. 10,300 cal yr BP, when high rainfall stabilized (Berke 
et  al.,  2012),  savanna-herb  patches,  composed  of  Poaceae  and  Amar-
anthaceae,  started to shrink in response to moister environments and 
Moraceae flourished (Figs. 5, 7 and S1). Similarly, and contemporane-
ously,  at  higher  elevations  in  Mt.  Kilimanjaro  (Schüler  et  al.,  2012), 
warmer and wetter conditions than today were recorded, allowing the 
expansion of Afromontane and Ericaceous vegetation at the expense of 
grasslands.  Wetter  and  warmer  conditions  promoted  biomass  produc-
tion, and thus, fuels that intensified burning, this time mainly of woody 
taxa (Figs. 3 and 5d). The new high-resolution evidence is in agreement 
with previous studies (e.g. Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023; Karp et al., 
2023) that emphasized the role of vegetation for fire incidence. Cross- 
correlation  analyses  (see  Supplementary  material)  suggest  that  fire 
had a significant impact on some plant taxa during the Early Holocene. 
For instance, Olea and Trema were reduced, while Grewia, Myrica and 
Ericaceae increased in response to burning (Fig. S3). Similar vegetational 
patterns in response to fire emerged during the latest Pleistocene, with 
fire-induced  reductions  of  Trema  and  increases  of  Grewia  during  the 
period 16,600–12,000 cal yr BP (Fig. S4). 
Overall,  during  the  Holocene  AHP,  temperature  and  precipitation 
increased. We propose that the increase of moisture played a major role 
when  compared  to  the  latest  Pleistocene,  during  which  temperature 
changes  were  probably  more 
for  vegetational  re-
organizations.  Increasing  Holocene  moisture  triggered  the  trans-
formation of the savanna to the tropical rainforest at lower altitudes and 
increasing temperatures likely released the expansion of Afromontane 
vegetation  at  higher  elevations,  at  or  above  the  altitudinal  positions 
observed today.

5. Conclusions 
Our record provides detailed evidence of major shifts in vegetation. 
We assume that, during the latest Pleistocene and the Early Holocene, 
vegetation was in dynamic equilibrium with climate, as illustrated by 
the response curves of plant taxa to climatic change (Figs. 7, S1 and S2). 
Specifically,  our  response  analyses  show  that,  over  the  entire  study 
period  (16,600–9000  cal  yr  BP),  warm  and/or  humid  conditions  fav-
oured both Afromontane and tropical rainforest communities (Figs. 7, 
S1  and  S2).  Conversely,  colder  or  drier  periods  were  associated  with 
savanna grassland vegetation. Even minor changes in temperature and/ 
or  precipitation  likely  induced  vegetation  shifts,  arguing  for  the  high 
climate sensitivity of tropical and Afromontane vegetation. Fire regime 
changed also according to climate and vegetation, acting as a co-driver 
in the ecosystem dynamics. 
Our newly obtained high-resolution record provides insights into the 
environmental conditions characterized by shifts attributed to natural 
climatic  changes,  in  which  alterations  of  vegetation  composition  and 
structure took place, with temperature and moisture fluctuations likely 
acting  as  the  primary  driving  forces  to  cause  complete  biome  re-
organizations  in  the  area.  The  high  sensitivity  of  natural  ecosystems 
illustrated here may be used to assess the magnitude and rate of future 
vegetation  responses  to  warmer  and/or  moister  climate  conditions, 
especially where vegetation conditions are still close to natural. Inves-
tigating  the  subsequent  Mid  and  Late  Holocene  periods  with  enough 
temporal resolution, in combination with the effects of changes in land 
use,  could  provide  more  insights  to  better  assess  the  human-caused 
fragmentation of ecosystems.

Acalypha (2%) spread around Lake Victoria during this period. Changes 
in the Afromontane forests comprised the expansion of Olea, Celtis and 
Macaranga, while Podocarpus remained rare and others such as Myrica, 
Juniperus,  Ericaceae  and  Hagenia  decreased  markedly.  A  remarkable 
change  in  savanna  trees  and  shrub  communities  and  thicket  clumps 
occurred during LV4–2a (Fig. 4), with a shift from Combretum to Trema, 
likely indicating the expansion of evergreen Trema trees on the costs of 
drought-adapted Combretum shrublands. Subtropical and tropical trees 
or shrubs such as Phoenix-type and Alchornea spread during this phase 
with distinct pollen peaks at around 10,300 cal yr BP at the transition to 
zone  LV4–2b.  Interestingly,  Tetrorchidium  appeared  for  the  first  time 
together  with  Musanga  in  the  pollen  record,  likely  pointing  to  the 
persistence of canopy openings in a disturbed environment. At the onset 
of  this  subzone  around  10,700  cal  yr  BP  macroscopic  charcoal  origi-
nating from trees starts to decline after a last peak, suggesting that forest 
fires became less frequent than before.

rainforests  and  persistence  of  Afromontane  vegetation.  
At  ca. 


10,300 cal yr BP the dominance of Moraceae pollen rapidly increases 
from 30 to 40% suggesting that tropical rainforests spread abruptly (in 
<40 years; Figs. 2, 3 and 5f). Around 10,000 cal yr BP Moraceae was 
partly replaced over 100–200 years by tropical rainforest taxa such as 
Alchornea (ca. 5%) and Acalypha (ca. 3%). Furthermore, pollen taxa such 
as Phoenix-type and Tetrorchidium are lacking during this phase, indi-
cating a decline of these palms, shrubs or trees in the lake catchment. 
Fluctuations among the tropical rainforest tree taxa may indicate minor 
reorganizations  of  vegetation  composition  and  successional  processes 
towards closed forest canopy. Indeed, after 10,000 cal yr BP, arboreal 
pollen (AP) dominated by Moraceae, reaches peak values around 75%, 
suggesting  the  occurrence  of  rather  dense  forest  in  the  Lake  Victoria 
area.  Although  declining,  the  pioneer  tree  Musanga  persisted,  while 
Urera-type,  possibly  in  the  form  of  lianas  reaching  the  forest  canopy, 
spread. The expansion of tropical rainforest was not at the expense of 
Afromontane taxa with stable populations of Olea (pollen ca.10%) and 
Macaranga  (pollen  ca.  5%),  but  rather  the  savanna  vegetation  almost 
collapsed. Specifically, pollen of herbaceous taxa such as Poaceae (ca.

cool and dry (e.g. Amaranthaceae, Rumex, Acacia-type, Indigofera). For

4.1. Causes of vegetation dynamics in the latest Pleistocene 


During the latest Pleistocene at around ca. 19,000 cal yr BP (Hughes 
et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2023), dry and cool conditions prevailed across 
East  Africa  over  a  range  of  elevations,  from  the  summit  of  Mt.  Kili-
manjaro (Schüler et al., 2012) to intermediate and low altitudes such as 
at  Lake  Albert  (Berke  et  al.,  2014),  Lake  Tanganyika  (Vincens  et  al., 
1993) and Lake Victoria (Berke et al., 2012). The southward shift of the

Afrotropical rainbelt and reorganization of the monsoon circulation, in 
combination with a weakening of regional rainfall systems at ca. 17,000 
cal yr BP, altered the climate at lower elevation sites causing aridity, 
which played an important role in Tanzania, Ghana, the Niger-Sanaga 
and Congo watersheds (Stager et al., 2011). At this time, Lake Victoria 
was experiencing a desiccation phase, as evidenced by seismic data and 
the presence of a palaeo-vertisol (Beverly et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 
1996; Stager et al., 2011). In the surrounding region, grassland savanna 
became  the  dominant  landscape  feature,  alongside  the  coexistence  of 
Afromontane vegetation, until temperatures started to gradually rise by 
ca. 2 
C before 15,500 cal yr BP in eastern Africa (Berke et al., 2012; 
Figs. 7 and S2). Warming associated with the end of Heinrich event 1, at 
around 16,000 has been also documented in other regions such as the 
Mediterranean realm (Samartin et al., 2012) and in Europe north of the 
Alps (Bolland et al., 2020). In our study area, this shift in temperature 
induced ecosystem changes including increased grassland-savanna fire 
activity at around 16,000–15,500 cal yr BP (Figs. 3, 5d, S2). In agree-
ment with our evidence (pollen, grassy charcoal), Polycyclic Aromatic 
Hydrocarbons  (PAH)  show  that  biomass  burning  at  this  time  was 
dominated by angiosperms in the Lake Victoria area (Karp et al., 2023).

At Lake Masoko, ca. 700 km south of Lake Victoria, an expansion of 
semi-deciduous forests took place between 16,000 and 14,000 cal yr BP 
(Vincens  et  al.,  2007)  when  precipitation  was  rather  high.  It  is 
conceivable that warmer and/or moister conditions caused the minor 
increase of Olea abundances at Lake Victoria around 15,000 cal yr BP 
(Figs.  3  and  5).  However,  in  addition  to  higher  temperatures  (Berke 
et al., 2012), precipitation regimes must have varied significantly given 
that  some  lakes  in  eastern  Africa  started  to  dry  out  approximately  at 
15,000 cal yr BP (L´ezine, 2007). Indeed, afforestation was interrupted 
ca. 200 km north-west of Lake Victoria at Lake Albert and further west in 
western Africa at Lake Bosumtwi (Bonnefille and Riollet, 1988) and herb 
taxa re-expanded in the surroundings of Lake Magadi ca. 250 km south- 
east of Lake Victoria (Elmoutaki, 1994).

Afromontane Olea spread at ca. 13,250 cal. yr BP (Figs. 3 and 5f), 
while  drought-adapted  trees  and  shrubs  declined,  the  thicket  clumps 
expanded in the savanna. This vegetation shift likely promoted diverse 
microclimates within the savanna, which helped among others, to retain 
water. The expansion of Olea was followed by other Afromontane trees 
such as Podocarpus, Celtis and Macaranga, the latter preferring swamp 
forest habitats (Beuning, 1999a). Our results also show that the savanna 
herbs  contracted  slightly,  while  tropical  rainforest  taxa  such  as  Mor-
aceae,  Acalypha  and  Alchornea  benefitted,  probably  forming  fringing 
forests  due  to  the  return  to  more  humid  conditions,  as  suggested  by 
Tryon et al. (2016). Indeed, the lake levels of Lake Victoria rose between 
14,000  and  13,600  cal  yr  BP  (Wienhues  et  al.,  2023),  implying  that 
moisture availability increased. About 300 km south of Lake Victoria, 
the  Miombo  flora  diversified  around  Lake  Tanganyika,  promoting  di-
versity  in  the  savanna  with  more  moisture-loving  plants  (Vincens, 
1991).

The  latest  Pleistocene  increase  of  Afromontane  pollen  has  led  to 
debates  about  long-distance  transport  (e.g.  Beuning,  1999a;  Kendall, 
1969; Ssemmanda and Vincens, 2018). At Lake Victoria the increase of 
Afromontane  pollen is recorded at all coring sites, and over  long dis-
tances  (e.g.  LV4  in  Temoltzin-Loranca  et  al.,  2023  vs.  P2  in  Kendall, 
1969, and V95–2P, in Beuning, 1999a). Therefore, it is likely that the 
expansion  of  Afromontane  vegetation  at  around  13,250  cal  yr  BP 
occurred throughout the entire Lake Victoria catchment. Moreover, we 
propose  that  due  to  cooler  conditions,  the  Afromontane  stands  were 
growing  at  lower  altitudes  and  closer  to  the  lake  shore  than  today 
(Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023).

Between ca. 12,800–11,700 cal yr BP water tables dropped at several 
lakes in East Africa, suggesting arid conditions (Roberts et al., 1993). 
However, hydroclimatic reconstructions indicate that this was not the 
case at Lake Victoria (Casta˜neda et  al., 2016; Overpeck et al., 1996). 
Forest  cover  remained  comparable  to  the  preceding  period,  when 
arboreal pollen (AP) reached ca. 20–25%, while pollen influx slightly 
declined (Fig. 5e). At this time, our data point to minor expansions of 
tropical rainforest taxa (e.g., Moraceae, Alchornea), which occurred at 
the expenses of Afromontane Olea but not Podocarpus (Fig. 2). Such a 
vegetation response would require a minor warming and/or moisture 
increase, which is indeed recorded in the Lake Victoria palaeoclimatic 
proxies (Berke et al., 2012, see Figs. 3, 7, S1, S2).

Increasing moisture during the latest Pleistocene prompted changes 
in aquatic plant communities (Figs. 2, S1). Kendall (1969) had already 
noticed an increase in Nymphaea at ca. 14,500 cal yr BP, interpreting it 
as  a change of water chemistry, probably in pH, resulting from more 
diluted  conditions.  This  finding  agrees  well  with  the  inference  of  a 
continuous water table rise at Lake Victoria (Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 
2023; Wienhues et al., 2023). Our new macrophyte pollen record refines 
this  notion  and  suggests  that  Nymphaea  caerulea  and  Nymphaea  lotus 
formed stands rather close to the coring site, together with other mac-
rophytes  such  as  Lemna  and  Potamogeton  during  the  period 
16,600–13,800  cal  yr  BP,  when  lake-levels  were  lower  than  today

In sum, during the period 16,600–11,500 cal yr BP, prior to the onset 
of the Holocene, the Lake Victoria basin was characterized by gradually 
increasing  temperatures  and  precipitation.  The  grassy  savanna  was 
converted into a woodland savanna, and subtropical or warm-temperate 
Afromontane taxa became more prominent at lower elevations together 
with  rare  first  gallery  or  tropical  rainforest  patches  (Fig.  4).  Fires 
occurred  regularly  throughout  the  period,  with  a  change  in  biomass 
burnt at around 13,800 cal yr BP, from a mostly grass-dominated fuel 
type during the earliest part of the period to a woody-dominated fuel 
type after this period.

Increases  in  temperatures  and  moisture  were  likely  caused  by  the 
strengthening of the East African Monsoon activity, towards the onset of 
the Holocene (Tierney et al., 2011). During the Holocene AHP, monsoon 
activity was higher across East Africa (Dallmeyer et al., 2020; Liu et al., 
2017), inducing more mesic conditions. Enhanced trade wind circula-
tion  and  moisture increase  led to two  sharp peaks of  pollen influx  in 
tropical Africa (L´ezine, 1998) as also observed in our record (Fig. 5e). At 
Lake Victoria, increases in temperature and precipitation caused a rapid 
transformation from savanna to tropical rainforest (Fig. 7), while Afro-
montane  vegetation  probably  moved  to  higher  altitudes  where  tem-
peratures were likely cooler (Kendall, 1969; Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 
2023).

Previous studies in Lake Victoria discussed the timing of the spread 
of the tropical rainforest. For instance, in V95–2P (Beuning, 1999a), an 
initial phase was recognized in the Late Pleistocene (11,200 14C yr BP, 
ca. 13,100 cal yr BP), after which a discontinuity attributed to a hiatus in 
sedimentation  occurred,  preventing  any  more  detailed  assessment.  In 
this study we show that, after an initial spread at the earliest Holocene, 
the  main  tropical  rainforest  expansion  to  >20%  occurred  at  ca. 
10,700–10,500  cal  yr  BP  (Fig.  2).  This  finding  is  supported  by  three 
other  sedimentary  records  with  independent  chronologies:  LV1,  LV2; 
(Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023), and by the core P2 (Kendall, 1969), 
where the tropical rainforest expansion is dated at ca. 9500 14C yr BP, 
corresponding to 10,900 cal yr BP.

The climatic change was more abrupt during the Early Holocene than 
during the latest Pleistocene, with precipitation increasing more rapidly 
than  temperature  at  ca.  11,500–10,700  cal  yr  BP.  (Figs.  3  and  5). 
Concurrently, a simultaneous rise in biomass burning accompanied the 
biome  reorganization.  Specifically,  at  ca.  11,700–11,100  cal  yr  BP 
Moraceae increased from ca. 3–5% (at the end of the Younger Dryas), to 
ca. 5–10% during the Early Holocene. The first Moraceae peak of >10% 
occurred  at ca. 11,200 cal yr BP, when precipitation  peaked (Fig. 5). 
When Moraceae expanded more massively at ca. 10,700 cal yr BP, the 
Afromontane  vegetation  spread  as  well.  This  spread  of  the  tropical 
rainforest and Afromontane plants is congruent with similar dynamics at 
other sites in the region, displaying expansions of Afromontane (mainly 
Olea), and pioneer forest taxa (Alchornea, Macaranga; L´ezine, 2007). At 
Lake  Victoria,  increased  rainfall  promoted  the  establishment  of  gap 
colonizer trees such as Tetrorchidium and Musanga. While the former is 
well adapted to moist conditions in the understories, the latter is well 
known for adapting in nutrient-poor or disturbed areas (Akinnifesi et al., 
2010; De Caluw´e and De Smedt, 2005; Vincens, 1991). Kendall (1969) 
suspected  a  misidentification  of  Musanga  pollen,  causing  a  spurious 
peak; in our record, we observe the same increase at the same time, so 
we can infer that its expansion, together with that of Urera-type, was 
real. It is plausible that this marked the initial stage of forest densifi-
cation, with some canopy openings, as observed in Gabon in more recent 
times  (Ngomanda  et  al.,  2005).  Consequently,  the  incidence  of  fires 
likely declined between 10,500 and 9700 cal yr BP.

Later at ca. 10,300 cal yr BP, when high rainfall stabilized (Berke 
et  al.,  2012),  savanna-herb  patches,  composed  of  Poaceae  and  Amar-
anthaceae,  started to shrink in response to moister environments and 
Moraceae flourished (Figs. 5, 7 and S1). Similarly, and contemporane-
ously,  at  higher  elevations  in  Mt.  Kilimanjaro  (Schüler  et  al.,  2012), 
warmer and wetter conditions than today were recorded, allowing the 
expansion of Afromontane and Ericaceous vegetation at the expense of 
grasslands.  Wetter  and  warmer  conditions  promoted  biomass  produc-
tion, and thus, fuels that intensified burning, this time mainly of woody 
taxa (Figs. 3 and 5d). The new high-resolution evidence is in agreement 
with previous studies (e.g. Temoltzin-Loranca et al., 2023; Karp et al., 
2023) that emphasized the role of vegetation for fire incidence. Cross- 
correlation  analyses  (see  Supplementary  material)  suggest  that  fire 
had a significant impact on some plant taxa during the Early Holocene. 
For instance, Olea and Trema were reduced, while Grewia, Myrica and 
Ericaceae increased in response to burning (Fig. S3). Similar vegetational 
patterns in response to fire emerged during the latest Pleistocene, with 
fire-induced  reductions  of  Trema  and  increases  of  Grewia  during  the

Overall,  during  the  Holocene  AHP,  temperature  and  precipitation 
increased. We propose that the increase of moisture played a major role 
when  compared  to  the  latest  Pleistocene,  during  which  temperature 
changes  were  probably  more 
for  vegetational  re-
organizations.  Increasing  Holocene  moisture  triggered  the  trans-
formation of the savanna to the tropical rainforest at lower altitudes and 
increasing temperatures likely released the expansion of Afromontane 
vegetation  at  higher  elevations,  at  or  above  the  altitudinal  positions 
observed today.

5. Conclusions 


Our record provides detailed evidence of major shifts in vegetation. 
We assume that, during the latest Pleistocene and the Early Holocene, 
vegetation was in dynamic equilibrium with climate, as illustrated by 
the response curves of plant taxa to climatic change (Figs. 7, S1 and S2). 
Specifically,  our  response  analyses  show  that,  over  the  entire  study 
period  (16,600–9000  cal  yr  BP),  warm  and/or  humid  conditions  fav-
oured both Afromontane and tropical rainforest communities (Figs. 7, 
S1  and  S2).  Conversely,  colder  or  drier  periods  were  associated  with 
savanna grassland vegetation. Even minor changes in temperature and/ 
or  precipitation  likely  induced  vegetation  shifts,  arguing  for  the  high 
climate sensitivity of tropical and Afromontane vegetation. Fire regime 
changed also according to climate and vegetation, acting as a co-driver 
in the ecosystem dynamics.

Our newly obtained high-resolution record provides insights into the 
environmental conditions characterized by shifts attributed to natural 
climatic  changes,  in  which  alterations  of  vegetation  composition  and 
structure took place, with temperature and moisture fluctuations likely 
acting  as  the  primary  driving  forces  to  cause  complete  biome  re-
organizations  in  the  area.  The  high  sensitivity  of  natural  ecosystems 
illustrated here may be used to assess the magnitude and rate of future 
vegetation  responses  to  warmer  and/or  moister  climate  conditions, 
especially where vegetation conditions are still close to natural. Inves-
tigating  the  subsequent  Mid  and  Late  Holocene  periods  with  enough 
temporal resolution, in combination with the effects of changes in land 
use,  could  provide  more  insights  to  better  assess  the  human-caused 
fragmentation of ecosystems.
