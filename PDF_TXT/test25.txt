10.1029/2022JD038046 ZHANG ET AL. Evapotranspiration (ET) constitutes the water exchange from land to the atmosphere, which in turn modulates precipitation and soil moisture (SM). Multiple lines of evidence document complex feedbacks between changes in ET and temperature, atmospheric CO and vegetation greening. However, the existing analyses on global changes in ET do not account for the direct effects of SM supply and atmospheric water demand, expressed by vapor pressure deficit (VPD), while considering multiple environmental variables. Here we evaluated the performance of ET products using 140 flux towers included in the FLUXNET database. All ET products show reasonable performance, with an overall correlation higher than 0.7 and better performance at a higher latitude. From analysis of the ensemble mean of annual ET, we show insignificant ( = 0.06) trends in global ET during 1982–2020 and a significantly ( < 0.01) increasing trend during 2002–2020. Changes in GLEAM ET generally exert a positive response to changes in SM and a negative response to changes in VPD. Yet, these effects are not globally consistent and are largely determined by changes in vegetation transpiration. Using our finding as a benchmark, Earth System Models mostly reproduce the positive response of ET to SM with less coupling strength, while showing negative effects of VPD on ET with stronger coupling strength. Our study highlights that concurrent soil drying and atmospheric aridity could intensify water exchanges and the importance of realistically representing SM-VPD-ET interactions in models for accurate predictions of the hydrological cycle. Evapotranspiration (ET) links the water exchange between land and the atmosphere, and thereby plays an important role in regulating precipitation and soil moisture (SM). In this study, using FLUXNET in situ observations we demonstrate the high performance of different ET products (GLEAM, ERA5, GLDAS, and MERRA2) which are widely used to characterize long-term changes in global ET. Decreases in SM and increases in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are expected to lead to decreases in ET worldwide. Using our observations as a benchmark, most of Earth System Models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 underestimate the positive response of ET to SM, while overestimating the negative effects of VPD on ET. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of SM and VPD on global changes in ET. Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an essential role in transferring water and energy between land and the atmosphere, and, ranked after precipitation, ET is the second-largest component of the terrestrial water cycle (Trenberth et al., 2007). Changes in ET affect not only precipitation and land surface water availability, but also the sensible heat flux by altering land surface temperature (Wang & Dickinson, 2012). Transpiration affects photosynthesis (Wang & Dickinson, 2012) and thus the variations of ET indirectly regulate the terrestrial carbon cycle (Biederman et al., 2017). Several studies have investigated ET trends at a global scale, but the magnitude and direction of reported trends varied in space and time. Moreover, these findings are generally associated with large uncertainties due to various data sources used (Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2016). The overall trends (increasing or decreasing) in global ET since the 1980s are inconclusive across these studies (Liu, Zhang, et al., 2021; Miralles et al., 2014; 1 of 15 Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2016), with a decrease in global ET during 1998–2008 (Jung et al., 2010) and an increasing trend for the period 1982–2011 (Pan et al., 2020) being reported in recent analyses. Changes in ET can be controlled by the available water in the soil (Jung et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2016), anthropogenic influences (Douville et al., 2013; Sterling et al., 2013), climate variability (i.e., El Niño–Southern Oscillation) (Miralles et al., 2014), increasing temperature (Wang et al., 2022), as well as vegetation greening that controls transpiration (Wang et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, changes in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and wind speed can affect ET (Zeng et al., 2012). In particular, increasing VPD induces an atmospheric demand for vapor that leads to increases in ET, while causing stomata closure for further increasing VPD that leads to decreases in ET (Massmann et al., 2019). Moreover, increasing atmospheric CO could reduce ET by decreasing leaf stomatal conductance (Keenan et al., 2013), which is countered by increasing leaf area at the canopy level (Zhu et al., 2016). Among these drivers, soil moisture (SM) (water supply) and VPD (water demand) exert direct effects on ET. However, the respective controls of SM and VPD on ET are largely unknown. Covarying forcing variables, such as temperature, precipitation or vegetation status, are strongly intertwined and cannot be considered separately, yet only a limited number of variables are typically taken into account in previous studies (Douville et al., 2013; Jung et al., 2010; Miralles et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). Anchored in a process-based understanding, ESMs can simulate the water cycle response to climate change and enable projections of future changes in the global water cycle (Pan et al., 2015). An accurate response of ET to changes in forcing variables is critical for a better understanding of interactions between climate and hydrology. This research area is however currently not fully explored. In this study, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of SM and VPD and their impacts on ET. We first analyzed trends in ET during 1982–2020 using multiple state-of-the-art ET products. We then assessed the impacts of SM and VPD and other environmental variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, runoff, wind speed, leaf area index, short vegetation cover, tree cover) on the interannual variability of ET. Finally, by using our finding as a benchmark, we diagnosed the simulated relationships between ET and SM/VPD from 40 ESMs included in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase (CMIP6). We extracted ET and SM data for 1982–2020 from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model version 3 (GLEAM-v3) (Martens et al., 2017). GLEAM-v3 estimates the actual evaporation by multiplying potential evaporation with an evaporative stress factor. Potential evaporation is calculated based on the Priestley and Taylor equation (Priestley & Taylor, 1972) using observations of surface net radiation and near-surface air temperature. The evaporative stress factor is calculated as a function of microwave vegetation optical depth and root-zone SM. The latter is calculated using a multi-layer soil water balance that describes the infiltration of observed precipitamodel (Martens et al., 2017). The monthly ET and root-zone SM data are provided with a spatial resolution of 0.25° and temporal coverage of 1980–2020. In this study, we also used soil evaporation, transpiration and canopy interception from GLEAM-v3. In total we extracted five other global ET products (Table 1) from MOD16A3, the fifth-generation ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA5) (Hersbach et al., 2020), the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA2) (Gelaro et al., 2017) and Global Land Data Assimilation System ET (GLDAS) (Rodell et al., 2004). In addition, we processed a data-driven ET product with a relatively short-term record, namely FLUXCOM (2001–2013) (Jung et al., 2010) which is generated using a machine-learning approach integrating satellite remote sensing and surface meteorological data. These five ET products are generated using independent systems and algorithms and their accuracies have been evaluated in multiple studies (Lu et al., 2021; Martens et al., 2017). All ET products were resampled to a spatial resolution of 0.25° using bilinear interpolation. We extracted the monthly latent heat flux (LE) covering the period of 1991–2014 from the FLUXNET 2015 database (Pastorello et al., 2020), where LE data are available at 206 flux towers across the globe (Figure S1 ZHANG ET AL. 2 of 15 in Supporting Information S1). ET was obtained from LE by multiplying a fixed factor of 2.45 MJ kg . The monthly ET observations were used to validate the performance of various ET products used in this study. VPD was calculated as the difference between saturated water vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure. Saturated water vapor pressure was determined by near-surface (2 m) temperature and actual water vapor pressure was determined by dew-point temperature. Air temperature and dew-point temperature from ERA5 were used to calculate VPD. We analyzed the impacts of covarying environmental variables on ET. For this we extracted data on air temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation and wind speed, obtained from ERA5. The impacts related to vegetation conditions were also considered by extracting the leaf area index (LAI) during the growing season from the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS) LAI3g data set. We averaged LAI during the growing season determined by the monthly climatology temperature above 0°C for each grid cell of the global vegetated area. Moreover, we extracted MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields products to derive a percentage of tree cover, short vegetation cover and bare ground. These variables are based on the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer and are available for 1982–2016. We extracted Köppen-Geiger climate classification data to indicate different climatic zones (Peel et al., 2007). We extracted monthly ET, SM, air temperature, precipitation and solar radiation for 1982–2014 from 40 ESMs relative humidity. Solar net radiation was calculated based on the differences between surface downwelling shortwave radiation and surface upwelling shortwave radiation. For our CMIP6 analysis, a subset of three covarying variables were selected, namely temperature, precipitation and solar radiation. The remaining variables are not commonly available across the ESMs. The monthly data were resampled to 1° using bilinear interpolation and then aggregated to an annual scale (i.e., average monthly temperature and solar radiation, sum monthly precipitation) for further analysis. We first validated the long-term records of various ET products GLEAM, ERA5, GLDAS, and MERRA2 using the FLUXNET data. In order to obtain relevant observations, we excluded FLUXNET flux towers with ET records less than 2 years. In total, 140 towers with in situ measurements of ET were kept. Considering the limited overlapping times available between in situ observations and these ET products, we used monthly observations to derive robust Pearson's correlation coefficients between them, which were used to assess the performance of the reanalysis ET products. ET products of FLUXCOM and MOD16A3 were not included due to their shorter period of observations (dating back to 2001). ZHANG ET AL. 3 of 15 To explore the respective effects of SM and VPD on ET, we first used SM to bin ET at a pixel level, in which ET corresponding to high VPD (75–100th percentiles) and low VPD (0–25th percentiles) were extracted to assess the changes in ET at high VPD and low VPD levels as a function of SM. Correspondingly, changes in ET at high moisture and low moisture levels were assessed as a function of VPD. Moreover, we used bivariate copulas to assess the co-occurrence probability (or joint probability) of annual SM and VPD anomalies at 10 × 10 percentile bins (Zhou et al., 2019; Zscheischler & Seneviratne, 2017). Following Liu et al. (2020) and Dang et al. (2022), the mean values at the 10 × 10 percentile bins can be used to quantify the respective effects of SM and VPD on ET. This binning method was suggested to be able to decouple the two variables of SM and VPD (Dang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020). Data were excluded from analysis if the number of data observations were less than 10 in a given bin. To better understand the independent effects of SM and VPD on ET in the spatial domain, we used the partial Spearman's rank correlation to quantify the respective impacts of SM and VPD on ET at the pixel level during 1982–2016. This was done by also taking into account the covarying environmental variables, including air temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, wind speed, leaf area index, tree cover, and short vegetation cover. Partial Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure of the strength and direction of association that exists between two variables, after controlling for a set of relevant variables. This method does not require that the measurement variables follow a normal distribution. We further detected the respective impacts of SM and VPD on GLEAM based transpiration, evaporation and canopy interception using partial correlations. The independent ET from ERA5 was used to test the robustness of their respective impacts. We conducted the partial correlation analysis based on the outputs of CMIP6 for the period of 1982–2014, and here only the covarying variables temperature, precipitation and solar radiation were considered. These variables were linearly detrended before calculating partial correlation coefficients and significant correlations were assessed at the 5% significance level ( < 0.05). Partial correlations were calculated for each model of the 40 ESMs (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1) and the multi-model mean correlations of the 40 ESMs were calculated for further analysis. The partial correlation coefficients were grouped using different climatic zones (Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1) based on Peel et al. (2007). For the purpose of comparison, we calculated partial correlation analogously based on GLEAM ET. The Theil-Sen estimator was used to quantify trends in annual ET, SM, and VPD during 1982–2020, and the Mann-Kendall test was used to determine trends at the 1% significance level ( < 0.01) which is supposed to retain robust decreasing or increasing trends. The three variables were normalized by the z-score: = ( – )/ ( ) (where and ( ) are the mean and standard deviation of ) before performing trend analysis to enable these changes to be comparable. Monthly ET derived from GLEAM, ERA5, GLDAS, and MERRA2 were validated using FLUXNET-based ET. Overall, the highest correlation was observed between ERA5 and FLUXNET ET ( = 0.75), followed by GLEAM ( = 0.73), GLDAS ( = 0.72) and MERRA2 ( = 0.71) (Figures 1a–1c). Using FLUXNET observations as benchmark, GLEAM and MERRA2 show a slight overestimation of ET (Figures 1a and 1d), while ERA5 and GLDAS show an overestimation of lower ET and an underestimation of higher ET (Figures 1b and 1c). Spatially, higher correlations between these ET products and FLUXNET ET were observed across most stations in northern America, Europe, China and Australia (Figures 1e–1h), including some stations with lower correlations. Lower correlations were generally observed in the regions of low latitudes (Figures 1e–1h). We observed a large interannual variation of global ET from 1982 to 2020 (Figure 2a). The state-of-the-art ET products generated from different resources generally show good agreements in the interannual variations and trends of ET at a global scale (Figure 2a). The average ET data showed insignificant trends in global ET for 1982– ZHANG ET AL. 4 of 15 ZHANG ET AL. 5 of 15 2020 (slope = 0.04, = 0.06), but a significant increase in global ET for the period 2002–2020 was observed (slope = 1.50, < 0.01). Moreover, we found that the spatial distribution of ET trends based on GLEAM during 1982–2020 was generally consistent with those ET trends derived from ERA5 and MERRA2 (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). Consequently, GLEAM ET was used as a representative ET data set in the following analysis. We further investigated trends in SM and VPD against ET at pixel level (0.25° × 0.25° per pixel). A dense distribution of pixels with negative trends in SM and positive trends in VPD was observed, showing a tendency for concurrent drying of soil and atmosphere (Figure 2b). Pixels with negative trends in ET were associated with strong negative trends in SM and positive trends in VPD (Figure 2c). This indicates that decreased SM or/and increased VPD lead to decreases in ET. The interplay between trends in VPD and SM and positive ET trends is less clear. Spatially, positive trends in ET during 1982–2020 were observed in most parts of the northern hemisphere, while ET in dryland areas such as the northern United States and the Sahel showed negative trends (Figure 3a). ZHANG ET AL. 6 of 15 Widespread negative trends in ET were observed in the southern hemisphere, particularly in Argentina and in the Congo basin. The percentage of pixels with positive trends in ET from low to high was ranked by tropical, arid, temperate, boreal, and polar biomes (Figure 3b). Similar spatial patterns of trends in SM were observed central Russia, where ET trends are found to be positive. Negative trends of SM account for more than half of the tropical, arid, and temperate biomes, while positive and negative trends cover almost equal areas in boreal and polar biomes (Figure 3d). Positive trends in VPD were observed globally and dominated in all biomes (Figures 3e and 3f). We accounted for nine environmental variables that potentially drive the interannual variability of ET using the partial Spearman correlation. Overall, strong positive correlations between ET and SM were observed in all climatic zones (Figure 4a). Positive correlations between ET and precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, leaf area index and tree cover were observed in all climatic zones. Strong negative correlations between ET and VPD were observed in tropical, drylands, and temperate biomes, while positive correlations occurred in boreal and polar biomes. Wind speed also shows negative impacts on ET in all climatic zones except for the polar region. The results suggest that these environmental variables exert strong impacts on ET, with the clearest effect from SM (positive effect) and VPD (negative effect) on ET (Figure 4a). It should also be noted that VPD exerts negative impacts on ET independent of temperature (Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1), though changes in VPD were mainly driven by temperature. Moreover, significant ( < 0.05) positive correlations between ET ZHANG ET AL. 7 of 15 and SM were observed in 64% of terrestrial land areas, but the correlations tend to be weaker at high latitudes (Figure 4b). Significant ( < 0.05) negative correlations between ET and VPD accounted for 46% of terrestrial land surfaces, while scattered pixels with positive correlations are observed at high latitudes, showing the inverse pattern in comparison to SM (Figure 4c). These impacts were further confirmed by ERA5 ET (Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1), showing the robustness of the patterns reported here. By investigating changes in ET at high and low VPD levels along the gradient of SM, we found that ET increased with increasing SM when SM was lower than 0.43 m m , beyond which ET decreased with SM increase is expected to be the main driver of variations in ET, whereas in humid regions the availability of energy is the dominating factor. A high VPD caused a high ET when SM is larger than 0.2 m m . For SM below 0.2 m m , ET did not react to a gradient in VPD. Similarly, ET increased with increasing VPD when VPD was lower than 3 hPA, whereas beyond this value ET decreased with increasing VPD (Figure 5b). High SM caused a higher ET with VPD greater than 3 hPA. We then analyzed the co-occurrence probability of annual mean SM and VPD in 10 × 10 percentile bins (Figure 5c) and the annual mean ET in each bin (Figure 5d). The results showed that VPD above the 20th percentile was mainly associated with SM above the 50th percentile. Moreover, the largest ET was observed at approximately the 40–60th percentiles of VPD and a high level of SM. The independent analysis using ERA5 ET supports the robustness of observed results (Figure S5 in Supporting Information S1). We conducted a partial Spearman correlation analysis between GLEAM ET components (transpiration, evaporation, and canopy interception) and SM/VPD accounting for the multiple environmental variables. Overall, SM and VPD were more closely correlated with transpiration than evaporation or canopy interception across all biomes (Figures 6a and 6b). The spatial pattern of SM/VPD that are correlated with transpiration shows a good agreement with the correlation analysis with ET (Figures 4b and 4c and Figures 6c and 6d). This suggests that ZHANG ET AL. 8 of 15 the effects of SM and VPD on ET are dominated by their respective influences on transpiration. Moreover, SM was observed to be positively related to evaporation and canopy interception (Figures 6e and 6f), whereas VPD was negatively related to evaporation and canopy interception. For both variables, the pixels with significant correlations ( < 0.05) were scattered globally, except for the significant correlations between SM and canopy interception observed in a region in the Amazon basin. We analyzed the simulated relationships between historical CMIP6 ET and SM/VPD with respect to variability in precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation for 40 ESMs in CMIP6. Overall, ESMs mostly reproduce the positive correlations between SM and ET (Figure 7a). Still, the magnitude of the multi-model mean correlations coefficient was lower than the correlations between SM and ET derived from GLEAM data (Figure 8), suggesting an underestimation of ET response to SM in the ESMs. Negative correlations between CMIP6 VPD and ET were observed in the tropical, arid, and temperate biomes, while positive correlations were found for boreal and polar biomes. This is in agreement with the identified correlations between ET and ERA5 VPD (Figure 4). The multi-model mean correlations between CMIP6 ET and VPD were higher than the correlations between ET and VPD, indicating ESMs overestimate the CMIP6 ET response to VPD. The spatial patterns of ESM generated correlations between CMIP6 based SM, VPD, and ET were similar to those based on ET, SM, and ERA5 VPD. However, a disagreement in the magnitude of correlations across the globe was identified (Figures 7b and 7c). Moreover, we found that the average correlation coefficients between CMIP6 SM and ET, or VPD and ET varied across models (Figure 8), but most ESMs showed good agreement in the spatial patterns of the correlations (Figures S6 and S7 in Supporting Information S1). Our study, based on multiple state-of-the-art ET products, showed insignificant trends ( = 0.06) in global ET from 1982 to 2020. However, a significantly increasing trend ( < 0.01) in the last two decades was identified ZHANG ET AL. 9 of 15 and the observed trends in ET were unambiguously revealed by six independent ET products and were largely consistent with previous studies (Pan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022). In previous studies, increases in global ET were primarily attributed to increasing air temperature (Scheff & Frierson, 2014; Wang et al., 2022). However, we identified more complex interactions, such as decreasing trends in ET that were locally constrained by decreasing trends in SM and increasing trends in VPD, which are expected to be intensified in the future due to climate warming. This is because rising temperature has been identified to drive moisture drying (Berg et al., 2017; Cook et al., 2020), and drive faster increases in saturated vapor pressure than actual vapor pressure thereby causing increases in VPD (Cook et al., 2018; Ficklin & Novick, 2017). This may further indicate an increasing role of SM and VPD in controlling global ET trends. We found that the importance of SM and VPD for ET dominated over rising temperature (Wang et al., 2022), vegetation greening (Bai et al., 2020), land cover changes (Sterling et al., 2013) and anthropogenic forcings (Liu, You, et al., 2021). This underpinned by changes in SM that directly supply water for ET and changes in VPD that determine the atmospheric demand for vapor, regulating leaf conductance that primarily controls transpiration (Lemordant et al., 2018). The respective impacts of SM and VPD on ET were further analyzed to show an overall positive impact of SM on ET and a negative impact of VPD on ET. It is plausible that a decrease in SM limits available water for vapor. ZHANG ET AL. 10 of 15 ZHANG ET AL. 11 of 15 Thus, this constraint of SM on ET can lead to decreased trends in ET alongside an overall drying of soils (Jung et al., 2010). However, the negative response on ET with high SM observed at high latitudes is probably due to abundant precipitation reducing the energy required for ET and the limited access of vegetation to radiation in these regions of radiation-constrained growth (Dorigo et al., 2012). The widespread negative impacts of VPD on ET suggest the dominant role of VPD in reducing the stomatal conductance of vegetation to prevent excess water loss by transpiration (Massmann et al., 2019). This process can potentially lead to decreases in ET given the predominant role of transpiration in determining changes in ET (Lemordant et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, high VPD can accelerate evaporation and reduce SM, strengthening its negative impact on ET. On the contrary, low VPD occurred at high latitudes, where it is positively related to ET as VPD can increase air demand of vapor that promotes increases in ET. Additionally, the analysis using independent data from ERA5 and most ESMs confirmed the robustness of the respective impacts and the observed spatial patterns. Most ESMs was found to realistically reproduce the strong coupling between ET and SM/VPD. Despite the large agreement in the spatial patterns of outputs at the global scale, the coupling strength was observed to vary considerably across ESMs. The overall underestimation of modeled ET response to SM can be attributed to the fact that ESMs account for the positive response of water use efficiency of vegetation to increasing atmospheric CO concentration (Lemordant et al., 2018). The vegetation-CO response reduces leaf-level transpiration, resulting in a decrease in the coupling between SM and ET. However, these “offline” simulations do not capture the effect of CO on ET (Lemordant et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020). Moreover, the underestimation of the ratio of plant transpiration to total ET in ESMs (Lian et al., 2018) can also contribute to the underestimation of the coupling between SM and ET, given that transpiration dominates the depletion of SM (Lian et al., 2020). This underestimation was attributed to an inaccurate representation of canopy light use, canopy interception loss and root water uptake processes in the ESMs (Lian et al., 2018). On the other hand, the elevated CO might also mitigate the VPD-induced stomatal limitation by enhancing water use efficiency at the leaf level (Dusenge et al., 2019). Yet, this effect could be counteracted at the canopy scale of widespread increase in leaf area (Zhu et al., 2016), leading to the overestimation of modeled ET response to VPD. Finally, the discrepancies in the response among ESMs can be attributed to the diverse parameterizations of surface energy and water processes from alternative strands of development of ESMs. Collectively, such bias of ET response to SM and VPD in ESMs can ultimately lead to uncertainties in the simulations of the terrestrial water cycle and surface energy balance under future conditions of climate change. A better understanding of the processes representing SM-VPD-ET interactions in ESMs is required to improve the reliability of projections of future changes in the hydrological cycle. In addition, this study has important implications for future changes in the interactions of SM-VPD-ET and how the interactions will respond to climate change. For example, the VPD has a positive effect on ET in polar and boreal regions where ET is energy limited, but negative in tropical and arid areas. However, shifts in these relationships are expected, as warming and drying may shift the dominant control of drivers on ecosystem water fluxes (Denissen et al., 2022; Novick et al., 2016). This is particularly plausible with respect to the hypothesis of “dry gets drier, wet gets wetter” (Chou et al., 2013; Feng & Zhang, 2015). FLUXNET database, some uncertainties may still exist in our analysis and our understanding of trends in ET or the established relationships between ET and SM/VPD. A relatively large uncertainty in ET products was observed in regions of low latitudes mainly covering the tropics as compared to regions of high latitudes (from approximately north of 30°N), suggesting that more empirical research is needed to confirm the effects of SM and VPD on ET in these regions. Moreover, the scale mismatch between flux tower sites and gridded pixels at 0.25° may contribute to this uncertainty, because the footprint of in situ observations is usually limited to a few kilometers for the site of the flux tower (Wang et al., 2015). This uncertainty can also be related to differences in land cover types (Zhu et al., 2022). Additionally, various spatial resolution of ESMs may cause under or overestimation in the responses of ET to SM and VPD. Our study provides a point-scale evaluation on various state-of-the-art ET products (i.e., ERA5, GLEAM, GLDAS, and MERRA2) and show reasonable performance for these ET products. Using these multiple ET datasets, we documented an insignificant trend ( = 0.06) in global ET during 1982–2020, but a significantly ( < 0.01) increasing trend in ET for the period 2002–2020. Positive correlations between SM and ET dominated the terrestrial ecosystems, except at high latitudes where SM was found to be negatively correlated with ET. VPD ZHANG ET AL. 12 of 15 (representing the atmospheric demand for vapor) was found to be negatively correlated with ET for large parts of the global land surface, but was positively correlated with ET at high latitudes. The respective impacts of SM and VPD on ET were found to be mainly controlled by their impacts on transpiration. ESMs can realistically simulate the spatial pattern of correlations between SM/VPD and ET, but substantial differences exist in the magnitude of the coupling strength among the models. These findings highlight that concurrent soil drying and increasing atmospheric aridity could play an increasing role in controlling water exchanges and further work is called for to improve simulations of SM-VPD-ET interactions in ESMs for more accurately predicting changes in the hydrological cycle under future climate change.

10.1029/2022JD038046 ZHANG ET AL. Evapotranspiration (ET) constitutes the water exchange from land to the atmosphere, which in turn modulates precipitation and soil moisture (SM). Multiple lines of evidence document complex feedbacks between changes in ET and temperature, atmospheric CO and vegetation greening. However, the existing analyses on global changes in ET do not account for the direct effects of SM supply and atmospheric water demand, expressed by vapor pressure deficit (VPD), while considering multiple environmental variables. Here we evaluated the performance of ET products using 140 flux towers included in the FLUXNET database. All ET products show reasonable performance, with an overall correlation higher than 0.7 and better performance at a higher latitude. From analysis of the ensemble mean of annual ET, we show insignificant ( = 0.06) trends in global ET during 1982–2020 and a significantly ( < 0.01) increasing trend during 2002–2020. Changes in GLEAM ET generally exert a positive response to changes in SM and a negative response to changes in VPD. Yet, these effects are not globally consistent and are largely determined by changes in vegetation transpiration. Using our finding as a benchmark, Earth System Models mostly reproduce the positive response of ET to SM with less coupling strength, while showing negative effects of VPD on ET with stronger coupling strength. Our study highlights that concurrent soil drying and atmospheric aridity could intensify water exchanges and the importance of realistically representing SM-VPD-ET interactions in models for accurate predictions of the hydrological cycle. Evapotranspiration (ET) links the water exchange between land and the atmosphere, and thereby plays an important role in regulating precipitation and soil moisture (SM). In this study, using FLUXNET in situ observations we demonstrate the high performance of different ET products (GLEAM, ERA5, GLDAS, and MERRA2) which are widely used to characterize long-term changes in global ET. Decreases in SM and increases in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are expected to lead to decreases in ET worldwide. Using our observations as a benchmark, most of Earth System Models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 underestimate the positive response of ET to SM, while overestimating the negative effects of VPD on ET. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of SM and VPD on global changes in ET. Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an essential role in transferring water and energy between land and the atmosphere, and, ranked after precipitation, ET is the second-largest component of the terrestrial water cycle (Trenberth et al., 2007). Changes in ET affect not only precipitation and land surface water availability, but also the sensible heat flux by altering land surface temperature (Wang & Dickinson, 2012). Transpiration affects photosynthesis (Wang & Dickinson, 2012) and thus the variations of ET indirectly regulate the terrestrial carbon cycle (Biederman et al., 2017). Several studies have investigated ET trends at a global scale, but the magnitude and direction of reported trends varied in space and time. Moreover, these findings are generally associated with large uncertainties due to various data sources used (Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2016). The overall trends (increasing or decreasing) in global ET since the 1980s are inconclusive across these studies (Liu, Zhang, et al., 2021; Miralles et al., 2014; 1 of 15 Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2016), with a decrease in global ET during 1998–2008 (Jung et al., 2010) and an increasing trend for the period 1982–2011 (Pan et al., 2020) being reported in recent analyses. Changes in ET can be controlled by the available water in the soil (Jung et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2016), anthropogenic influences (Douville et al., 2013; Sterling et al., 2013), climate variability (i.e., El Niño–Southern Oscillation) (Miralles et al., 2014), increasing temperature (Wang et al., 2022), as well as vegetation greening that controls transpiration (Wang et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, changes in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and wind speed can affect ET (Zeng et al., 2012). In particular, increasing VPD induces an atmospheric demand for vapor that leads to increases in ET, while causing stomata closure for further increasing VPD that leads to decreases in ET (Massmann et al., 2019). Moreover, increasing atmospheric CO could reduce ET by decreasing leaf stomatal conductance (Keenan et al., 2013), which is countered by increasing leaf area at the canopy level (Zhu et al., 2016). Among these drivers, soil moisture (SM) (water supply) and VPD (water demand) exert direct effects on ET. However, the respective controls of SM and VPD on ET are largely unknown. Covarying forcing variables, such as temperature, precipitation or vegetation status, are strongly intertwined and cannot be considered separately, yet only a limited number of variables are typically taken into account in previous studies (Douville et al., 2013; Jung et al., 2010; Miralles et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). Anchored in a process-based understanding, ESMs can simulate the water cycle response to climate change and enable projections of future changes in the global water cycle (Pan et al., 2015). An accurate response of ET to changes in forcing variables is critical for a better understanding of interactions between climate and hydrology. This research area is however currently not fully explored. In this study, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of SM and VPD and their impacts on ET. We first analyzed trends in ET during 1982–2020 using multiple state-of-the-art ET products. We then assessed the impacts of SM and VPD and other environmental variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, runoff, wind speed, leaf area index, short vegetation cover, tree cover) on the interannual variability of ET. Finally, by using our finding as a benchmark, we diagnosed the simulated relationships between ET and SM/VPD from 40 ESMs included in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase (CMIP6). We extracted ET and SM data for 1982–2020 from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model version 3 (GLEAM-v3) (Martens et al., 2017). GLEAM-v3 estimates the actual evaporation by multiplying potential evaporation with an evaporative stress factor. Potential evaporation is calculated based on the Priestley and Taylor equation (Priestley & Taylor, 1972) using observations of surface net radiation and near-surface air temperature. The evaporative stress factor is calculated as a function of microwave vegetation optical depth and root-zone SM. The latter is calculated using a multi-layer soil water balance that describes the infiltration of observed precipitamodel (Martens et al., 2017). The monthly ET and root-zone SM data are provided with a spatial resolution of 0.25° and temporal coverage of 1980–2020. In this study, we also used soil evaporation, transpiration and canopy interception from GLEAM-v3. In total we extracted five other global ET products (Table 1) from MOD16A3, the fifth-generation ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA5) (Hersbach et al., 2020), the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA2) (Gelaro et al., 2017) and Global Land Data Assimilation System ET (GLDAS) (Rodell et al., 2004). In addition, we processed a data-driven ET product with a relatively short-term record, namely FLUXCOM (2001–2013) (Jung et al., 2010) which is generated using a machine-learning approach integrating satellite remote sensing and surface meteorological data. These five ET products are generated using independent systems and algorithms and their accuracies have been evaluated in multiple studies (Lu et al., 2021; Martens et al., 2017). All ET products were resampled to a spatial resolution of 0.25° using bilinear interpolation. We extracted the monthly latent heat flux (LE) covering the period of 1991–2014 from the FLUXNET 2015 database (Pastorello et al., 2020), where LE data are available at 206 flux towers across the globe (Figure S1 ZHANG ET AL. 2 of 15 in Supporting Information S1). ET was obtained from LE by multiplying a fixed factor of 2.45 MJ kg . The monthly ET observations were used to validate the performance of various ET products used in this study. VPD was calculated as the difference between saturated water vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure. Saturated water vapor pressure was determined by near-surface (2 m) temperature and actual water vapor pressure was determined by dew-point temperature. Air temperature and dew-point temperature from ERA5 were used to calculate VPD. We analyzed the impacts of covarying environmental variables on ET. For this we extracted data on air temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation and wind speed, obtained from ERA5. The impacts related to vegetation conditions were also considered by extracting the leaf area index (LAI) during the growing season from the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS) LAI3g data set. We averaged LAI during the growing season determined by the monthly climatology temperature above 0°C for each grid cell of the global vegetated area. Moreover, we extracted MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields products to derive a percentage of tree cover, short vegetation cover and bare ground. These variables are based on the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer and are available for 1982–2016. We extracted Köppen-Geiger climate classification data to indicate different climatic zones (Peel et al., 2007). We extracted monthly ET, SM, air temperature, precipitation and solar radiation for 1982–2014 from 40 ESMs relative humidity. Solar net radiation was calculated based on the differences between surface downwelling shortwave radiation and surface upwelling shortwave radiation. For our CMIP6 analysis, a subset of three covarying variables were selected, namely temperature, precipitation and solar radiation. The remaining variables are not commonly available across the ESMs. The monthly data were resampled to 1° using bilinear interpolation and then aggregated to an annual scale (i.e., average monthly temperature and solar radiation, sum monthly precipitation) for further analysis. We first validated the long-term records of various ET products GLEAM, ERA5, GLDAS, and MERRA2 using the FLUXNET data. In order to obtain relevant observations, we excluded FLUXNET flux towers with ET records less than 2 years. In total, 140 towers with in situ measurements of ET were kept. Considering the limited overlapping times available between in situ observations and these ET products, we used monthly observations to derive robust Pearson's correlation coefficients between them, which were used to assess the performance of the reanalysis ET products. ET products of FLUXCOM and MOD16A3 were not included due to their shorter period of observations (dating back to 2001). ZHANG ET AL. 3 of 15 To explore the respective effects of SM and VPD on ET, we first used SM to bin ET at a pixel level, in which ET corresponding to high VPD (75–100th percentiles) and low VPD (0–25th percentiles) were extracted to assess the changes in ET at high VPD and low VPD levels as a function of SM. Correspondingly, changes in ET at high moisture and low moisture levels were assessed as a function of VPD. Moreover, we used bivariate copulas to assess the co-occurrence probability (or joint probability) of annual SM and VPD anomalies at 10 × 10 percentile bins (Zhou et al., 2019; Zscheischler & Seneviratne, 2017). Following Liu et al. (2020) and Dang et al. (2022), the mean values at the 10 × 10 percentile bins can be used to quantify the respective effects of SM and VPD on ET. This binning method was suggested to be able to decouple the two variables of SM and VPD (Dang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020). Data were excluded from analysis if the number of data observations were less than 10 in a given bin. To better understand the independent effects of SM and VPD on ET in the spatial domain, we used the partial Spearman's rank correlation to quantify the respective impacts of SM and VPD on ET at the pixel level during 1982–2016. This was done by also taking into account the covarying environmental variables, including air temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, wind speed, leaf area index, tree cover, and short vegetation cover. Partial Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure of the strength and direction of association that exists between two variables, after controlling for a set of relevant variables. This method does not require that the measurement variables follow a normal distribution. We further detected the respective impacts of SM and VPD on GLEAM based transpiration, evaporation and canopy interception using partial correlations. The independent ET from ERA5 was used to test the robustness of their respective impacts. We conducted the partial correlation analysis based on the outputs of CMIP6 for the period of 1982–2014, and here only the covarying variables temperature, precipitation and solar radiation were considered. These variables were linearly detrended before calculating partial correlation coefficients and significant correlations were assessed at the 5% significance level ( < 0.05). Partial correlations were calculated for each model of the 40 ESMs (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1) and the multi-model mean correlations of the 40 ESMs were calculated for further analysis. The partial correlation coefficients were grouped using different climatic zones (Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1) based on Peel et al. (2007). For the purpose of comparison, we calculated partial correlation analogously based on GLEAM ET. The Theil-Sen estimator was used to quantify trends in annual ET, SM, and VPD during 1982–2020, and the Mann-Kendall test was used to determine trends at the 1% significance level ( < 0.01) which is supposed to retain robust decreasing or increasing trends. The three variables were normalized by the z-score: = ( – )/ ( ) (where and ( ) are the mean and standard deviation of ) before performing trend analysis to enable these changes to be comparable. Monthly ET derived from GLEAM, ERA5, GLDAS, and MERRA2 were validated using FLUXNET-based ET. Overall, the highest correlation was observed between ERA5 and FLUXNET ET ( = 0.75), followed by GLEAM ( = 0.73), GLDAS ( = 0.72) and MERRA2 ( = 0.71) (Figures 1a–1c). Using FLUXNET observations as benchmark, GLEAM and MERRA2 show a slight overestimation of ET (Figures 1a and 1d), while ERA5 and GLDAS show an overestimation of lower ET and an underestimation of higher ET (Figures 1b and 1c). Spatially, higher correlations between these ET products and FLUXNET ET were observed across most stations in northern America, Europe, China and Australia (Figures 1e–1h), including some stations with lower correlations. Lower correlations were generally observed in the regions of low latitudes (Figures 1e–1h). We observed a large interannual variation of global ET from 1982 to 2020 (Figure 2a). The state-of-the-art ET products generated from different resources generally show good agreements in the interannual variations and trends of ET at a global scale (Figure 2a). The average ET data showed insignificant trends in global ET for 1982– ZHANG ET AL. 4 of 15 ZHANG ET AL. 5 of 15 2020 (slope = 0.04, = 0.06), but a significant increase in global ET for the period 2002–2020 was observed (slope = 1.50, < 0.01). Moreover, we found that the spatial distribution of ET trends based on GLEAM during 1982–2020 was generally consistent with those ET trends derived from ERA5 and MERRA2 (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). Consequently, GLEAM ET was used as a representative ET data set in the following analysis. We further investigated trends in SM and VPD against ET at pixel level (0.25° × 0.25° per pixel). A dense distribution of pixels with negative trends in SM and positive trends in VPD was observed, showing a tendency for concurrent drying of soil and atmosphere (Figure 2b). Pixels with negative trends in ET were associated with strong negative trends in SM and positive trends in VPD (Figure 2c). This indicates that decreased SM or/and increased VPD lead to decreases in ET. The interplay between trends in VPD and SM and positive ET trends is less clear. Spatially, positive trends in ET during 1982–2020 were observed in most parts of the northern hemisphere, while ET in dryland areas such as the northern United States and the Sahel showed negative trends (Figure 3a). ZHANG ET AL. 6 of 15 Widespread negative trends in ET were observed in the southern hemisphere, particularly in Argentina and in the Congo basin. The percentage of pixels with positive trends in ET from low to high was ranked by tropical, arid, temperate, boreal, and polar biomes (Figure 3b). Similar spatial patterns of trends in SM were observed central Russia, where ET trends are found to be positive. Negative trends of SM account for more than half of the tropical, arid, and temperate biomes, while positive and negative trends cover almost equal areas in boreal and polar biomes (Figure 3d). Positive trends in VPD were observed globally and dominated in all biomes (Figures 3e and 3f). We accounted for nine environmental variables that potentially drive the interannual variability of ET using the partial Spearman correlation. Overall, strong positive correlations between ET and SM were observed in all climatic zones (Figure 4a). Positive correlations between ET and precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, leaf area index and tree cover were observed in all climatic zones. Strong negative correlations between ET and VPD were observed in tropical, drylands, and temperate biomes, while positive correlations occurred in boreal and polar biomes. Wind speed also shows negative impacts on ET in all climatic zones except for the polar region. The results suggest that these environmental variables exert strong impacts on ET, with the clearest effect from SM (positive effect) and VPD (negative effect) on ET (Figure 4a). It should also be noted that VPD exerts negative impacts on ET independent of temperature (Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1), though changes in VPD were mainly driven by temperature. Moreover, significant ( < 0.05) positive correlations between ET ZHANG ET AL. 7 of 15 and SM were observed in 64% of terrestrial land areas, but the correlations tend to be weaker at high latitudes (Figure 4b). Significant ( < 0.05) negative correlations between ET and VPD accounted for 46% of terrestrial land surfaces, while scattered pixels with positive correlations are observed at high latitudes, showing the inverse pattern in comparison to SM (Figure 4c). These impacts were further confirmed by ERA5 ET (Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1), showing the robustness of the patterns reported here. By investigating changes in ET at high and low VPD levels along the gradient of SM, we found that ET increased with increasing SM when SM was lower than 0.43 m m , beyond which ET decreased with SM increase is expected to be the main driver of variations in ET, whereas in humid regions the availability of energy is the dominating factor. A high VPD caused a high ET when SM is larger than 0.2 m m . For SM below 0.2 m m , ET did not react to a gradient in VPD. Similarly, ET increased with increasing VPD when VPD was lower than 3 hPA, whereas beyond this value ET decreased with increasing VPD (Figure 5b). High SM caused a higher ET with VPD greater than 3 hPA. We then analyzed the co-occurrence probability of annual mean SM and VPD in 10 × 10 percentile bins (Figure 5c) and the annual mean ET in each bin (Figure 5d). The results showed that VPD above the 20th percentile was mainly associated with SM above the 50th percentile. Moreover, the largest ET was observed at approximately the 40–60th percentiles of VPD and a high level of SM. The independent analysis using ERA5 ET supports the robustness of observed results (Figure S5 in Supporting Information S1). We conducted a partial Spearman correlation analysis between GLEAM ET components (transpiration, evaporation, and canopy interception) and SM/VPD accounting for the multiple environmental variables. Overall, SM and VPD were more closely correlated with transpiration than evaporation or canopy interception across all biomes (Figures 6a and 6b). The spatial pattern of SM/VPD that are correlated with transpiration shows a good agreement with the correlation analysis with ET (Figures 4b and 4c and Figures 6c and 6d). This suggests that ZHANG ET AL. 8 of 15 the effects of SM and VPD on ET are dominated by their respective influences on transpiration. Moreover, SM was observed to be positively related to evaporation and canopy interception (Figures 6e and 6f), whereas VPD was negatively related to evaporation and canopy interception. For both variables, the pixels with significant correlations ( < 0.05) were scattered globally, except for the significant correlations between SM and canopy interception observed in a region in the Amazon basin. We analyzed the simulated relationships between historical CMIP6 ET and SM/VPD with respect to variability in precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation for 40 ESMs in CMIP6. Overall, ESMs mostly reproduce the positive correlations between SM and ET (Figure 7a). Still, the magnitude of the multi-model mean correlations coefficient was lower than the correlations between SM and ET derived from GLEAM data (Figure 8), suggesting an underestimation of ET response to SM in the ESMs. Negative correlations between CMIP6 VPD and ET were observed in the tropical, arid, and temperate biomes, while positive correlations were found for boreal and polar biomes. This is in agreement with the identified correlations between ET and ERA5 VPD (Figure 4). The multi-model mean correlations between CMIP6 ET and VPD were higher than the correlations between ET and VPD, indicating ESMs overestimate the CMIP6 ET response to VPD. The spatial patterns of ESM generated correlations between CMIP6 based SM, VPD, and ET were similar to those based on ET, SM, and ERA5 VPD. However, a disagreement in the magnitude of correlations across the globe was identified (Figures 7b and 7c). Moreover, we found that the average correlation coefficients between CMIP6 SM and ET, or VPD and ET varied across models (Figure 8), but most ESMs showed good agreement in the spatial patterns of the correlations (Figures S6 and S7 in Supporting Information S1). Our study, based on multiple state-of-the-art ET products, showed insignificant trends ( = 0.06) in global ET from 1982 to 2020. However, a significantly increasing trend ( < 0.01) in the last two decades was identified ZHANG ET AL. 9 of 15 and the observed trends in ET were unambiguously revealed by six independent ET products and were largely consistent with previous studies (Pan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022). In previous studies, increases in global ET were primarily attributed to increasing air temperature (Scheff & Frierson, 2014; Wang et al., 2022). However, we identified more complex interactions, such as decreasing trends in ET that were locally constrained by decreasing trends in SM and increasing trends in VPD, which are expected to be intensified in the future due to climate warming. This is because rising temperature has been identified to drive moisture drying (Berg et al., 2017; Cook et al., 2020), and drive faster increases in saturated vapor pressure than actual vapor pressure thereby causing increases in VPD (Cook et al., 2018; Ficklin & Novick, 2017). This may further indicate an increasing role of SM and VPD in controlling global ET trends. We found that the importance of SM and VPD for ET dominated over rising temperature (Wang et al., 2022), vegetation greening (Bai et al., 2020), land cover changes (Sterling et al., 2013) and anthropogenic forcings (Liu, You, et al., 2021). This underpinned by changes in SM that directly supply water for ET and changes in VPD that determine the atmospheric demand for vapor, regulating leaf conductance that primarily controls transpiration (Lemordant et al., 2018). The respective impacts of SM and VPD on ET were further analyzed to show an overall positive impact of SM on ET and a negative impact of VPD on ET. It is plausible that a decrease in SM limits available water for vapor. ZHANG ET AL. 10 of 15 ZHANG ET AL. 11 of 15 Thus, this constraint of SM on ET can lead to decreased trends in ET alongside an overall drying of soils (Jung et al., 2010). However, the negative response on ET with high SM observed at high latitudes is probably due to abundant precipitation reducing the energy required for ET and the limited access of vegetation to radiation in these regions of radiation-constrained growth (Dorigo et al., 2012). The widespread negative impacts of VPD on ET suggest the dominant role of VPD in reducing the stomatal conductance of vegetation to prevent excess water loss by transpiration (Massmann et al., 2019). This process can potentially lead to decreases in ET given the predominant role of transpiration in determining changes in ET (Lemordant et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, high VPD can accelerate evaporation and reduce SM, strengthening its negative impact on ET. On the contrary, low VPD occurred at high latitudes, where it is positively related to ET as VPD can increase air demand of vapor that promotes increases in ET. Additionally, the analysis using independent data from ERA5 and most ESMs confirmed the robustness of the respective impacts and the observed spatial patterns. Most ESMs was found to realistically reproduce the strong coupling between ET and SM/VPD. Despite the large agreement in the spatial patterns of outputs at the global scale, the coupling strength was observed to vary considerably across ESMs. The overall underestimation of modeled ET response to SM can be attributed to the fact that ESMs account for the positive response of water use efficiency of vegetation to increasing atmospheric CO concentration (Lemordant et al., 2018). The vegetation-CO response reduces leaf-level transpiration, resulting in a decrease in the coupling between SM and ET. However, these “offline” simulations do not capture the effect of CO on ET (Lemordant et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020). Moreover, the underestimation of the ratio of plant transpiration to total ET in ESMs (Lian et al., 2018) can also contribute to the underestimation of the coupling between SM and ET, given that transpiration dominates the depletion of SM (Lian et al., 2020). This underestimation was attributed to an inaccurate representation of canopy light use, canopy interception loss and root water uptake processes in the ESMs (Lian et al., 2018). On the other hand, the elevated CO might also mitigate the VPD-induced stomatal limitation by enhancing water use efficiency at the leaf level (Dusenge et al., 2019). Yet, this effect could be counteracted at the canopy scale of widespread increase in leaf area (Zhu et al., 2016), leading to the overestimation of modeled ET response to VPD. Finally, the discrepancies in the response among ESMs can be attributed to the diverse parameterizations of surface energy and water processes from alternative strands of development of ESMs. Collectively, such bias of ET response to SM and VPD in ESMs can ultimately lead to uncertainties in the simulations of the terrestrial water cycle and surface energy balance under future conditions of climate change. A better understanding of the processes representing SM-VPD-ET interactions in ESMs is required to improve the reliability of projections of future changes in the hydrological cycle. In addition, this study has important implications for future changes in the interactions of SM-VPD-ET and how the interactions will respond to climate change. For example, the VPD has a positive effect on ET in polar and boreal regions where ET is energy limited, but negative in tropical and arid areas. However, shifts in these relationships are expected, as warming and drying may shift the dominant control of drivers on ecosystem water fluxes (Denissen et al., 2022; Novick et al., 2016). This is particularly plausible with respect to the hypothesis of “dry gets drier, wet gets wetter” (Chou et al., 2013; Feng & Zhang, 2015). FLUXNET database, some uncertainties may still exist in our analysis and our understanding of trends in ET or the established relationships between ET and SM/VPD. A relatively large uncertainty in ET products was observed in regions of low latitudes mainly covering the tropics as compared to regions of high latitudes (from approximately north of 30°N), suggesting that more empirical research is needed to confirm the effects of SM and VPD on ET in these regions. Moreover, the scale mismatch between flux tower sites and gridded pixels at 0.25° may contribute to this uncertainty, because the footprint of in situ observations is usually limited to a few kilometers for the site of the flux tower (Wang et al., 2015). This uncertainty can also be related to differences in land cover types (Zhu et al., 2022). Additionally, various spatial resolution of ESMs may cause under or overestimation in the responses of ET to SM and VPD. Our study provides a point-scale evaluation on various state-of-the-art ET products (i.e., ERA5, GLEAM, GLDAS, and MERRA2) and show reasonable performance for these ET products. Using these multiple ET datasets, we documented an insignificant trend ( = 0.06) in global ET during 1982–2020, but a significantly ( < 0.01) increasing trend in ET for the period 2002–2020. Positive correlations between SM and ET dominated the terrestrial ecosystems, except at high latitudes where SM was found to be negatively correlated with ET. VPD ZHANG ET AL. 12 of 15 (representing the atmospheric demand for vapor) was found to be negatively correlated with ET for large parts of the global land surface, but was positively correlated with ET at high latitudes. The respective impacts of SM and VPD on ET were found to be mainly controlled by their impacts on transpiration. ESMs can realistically simulate the spatial pattern of correlations between SM/VPD and ET, but substantial differences exist in the magnitude of the coupling strength among the models. These findings highlight that concurrent soil drying and increasing atmospheric aridity could play an increasing role in controlling water exchanges and further work is called for to improve simulations of SM-VPD-ET interactions in ESMs for more accurately predicting changes in the hydrological cycle under future climate change.
